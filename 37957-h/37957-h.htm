<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>P R E F A C E.</h2>


<p>The object of the present volume is: to indicate the character
and, approximately, the extent of the changes produced
by human action in the physical conditions of the globe we
inhabit; to point out the dangers of imprudence and the necessity
of caution in all operations which, on a large scale, interfere
with the spontaneous arrangements of the organic or the
inorganic world; to suggest the possibility and the importance
of the restoration of disturbed harmonies and the material improvement
of waste and exhausted regions; and, incidentally,
to illustrate the doctrine, that man is, in both kind and degree,
a power of a higher order than any of the other forms of animated
life, which, like him, are nourished at the table of
bounteous nature.</p>

<p>In the rudest stages of life, man depends upon spontaneous
animal and vegetable growth for food and clothing, and his
consumption of such products consequently diminishes the
numerical abundance of the species which serve his uses. At
more advanced periods, he protects and propagates certain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>esculent vegetables and certain fowls and quadrupeds, and, at
the same time, wars upon rival organisms which prey upon
these objects of his care or obstruct the increase of their numbers.
Hence the action of man upon the organic world tends
to subvert the original balance of its species, and while it reduces
the numbers of some of them, or even extirpates them altogether,
it multiplies other forms of animal and vegetable life.</p>

<p>The extension of agricultural and pastoral industry involves
an enlargement of the sphere of man's domain, by encroachment
upon the forests which once covered the greater part of the
earth's surface otherwise adapted to his occupation. The felling
of the woods has been attended with momentous consequences
to the drainage of the soil, to the external configuration
of its surface, and probably, also, to local climate; and
the importance of human life as a transforming power is, perhaps,
more clearly demonstrable in the influence man has thus
exerted upon superficial geography than in any other result of
his material effort.</p>

<p>Lands won from the woods must be both drained and irrigated;
river banks and maritime coasts must be secured by
means of artificial bulwarks against inundation by inland and
by ocean floods; and the needs of commerce require the improvement
of natural, and the construction of artificial channels
of navigation. Thus man is compelled to extend over the
unstable waters the empire he had already founded upon the
solid land.</p>

<p>The upheaval of the bed of seas and the movements of
water and of wind expose vast deposits of sand, which occupy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
space required for the convenience of man, and often, by the
drifting of their particles, overwhelm the fields of human industry
with invasions as disastrous as the incursions of the ocean.
On the other hand, on many coasts, sand hills both protect
the shores from erosion by the waves and currents, and shelter
valuable grounds from blasting sea winds. Man, therefore,
must sometimes resist, sometimes promote, the formation and
growth of dunes, and subject the barren and flying sands to
the same obedience to his will to which he has reduced other
forms of terrestrial surface.</p>

<p>Besides these old and comparatively familiar methods of
material improvement, modern ambition aspires to yet grander
achievements in the conquest of physical nature, and projects
are meditated which quite eclipse the boldest enterprises hitherto
undertaken for the modification of geographical surface.</p>

<p>The natural character of the various fields where human
industry has effected revolutions so important, and where the
multiplying population and the impoverished resources of the
globe demand new triumphs of mind over matter, suggests a
corresponding division of the general subject, and I have conformed
the distribution of the several topics to the chronological
succession in which man must be supposed to have extended
his sway over the different provinces of his material
kingdom. I have, then, in the Introductory chapter, stated,
in a comprehensive way, the general effects and the prospective
consequences of human action upon the earth's surface
and the life which peoples it. This chapter is followed by
four others in which I have traced the history of man's indus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>try
as exerted upon Animal and Vegetable Life, upon the
Woods, upon the Waters, and upon the Sands; and to these
I have added a concluding chapter upon Probable and Possible
Geographical Revolutions yet to be effected by the art of
man.</p>

<p>I have only to add what, indeed, sufficiently appears upon
every page of the volume, that I address myself not to professed
physicists, but to the general intelligence of educated, observing,
and thinking men; and that my purpose is rather to make
practical suggestions than to indulge in theoretical speculations
properly suited to a different class from that to which
those for whom I write belong.</p>

<h4><i>Natural Advantages of the Territory of the Roman Empire.</i></h4>

<p>The Roman Empire, at the period of its greatest expansion,
comprised the regions of the earth most distinguished by a
happy combination of physical advantages. The provinces
bordering on the principal and the secondary basins of the
Mediterranean enjoyed a healthfulness and an equability of
climate, a fertility of soil, a variety of vegetable and mineral
products, and natural facilities for the transportation and distribution
of exchangeable commodities, which have not been
possessed in an equal degree by any territory of like extent
in the Old World or the New. The abundance of the land and
of the waters adequately supplied every material want, ministered
liberally to every sensuous enjoyment. Gold and silver,
indeed, were not found in the profusion which has proved so
baneful to the industry of lands richer in veins of the precious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
metals; but mines and river beds yielded them in the spare
measure most favorable to stability of value in the medium of
exchange, and, consequently, to the regularity of commercial
transactions. The ornaments of the barbaric pride of the
East, the pearl, the ruby, the sapphire, and the diamond&mdash;though
not unknown to the luxury of a people whose conquests
and whose wealth commanded whatever the habitable
world could contribute to augment the material splendor of
their social life&mdash;were scarcely native to the territory of the
empire; but the comparative rarity of these gems in Europe,
at somewhat earlier periods, was, perhaps, the very circumstance
that led the cunning artists of classic antiquity to
enrich softer stones with engravings, which invest the common
onyx and carnelian with a worth surpassing, in cultivated
eyes, the lustre of the most brilliant oriental jewels.</p>

<p>Of these manifold blessings the temperature of the air, the
distribution of the rains, the relative disposition of land and
water, the plenty of the sea, the composition of the soil, and
the raw material of some of the arts, were wholly gratuitous
gifts. Yet the spontaneous nature of Europe, of Western
Asia, of Libya, neither fed nor clothed the civilized inhabitants
of those provinces. Every loaf was eaten in the sweat of the
brow. All must be earned by toil. But toil was nowhere
else rewarded by so generous wages; for nowhere would a
given amount of intelligent labor produce so abundant, and, at
the same time, so varied returns of the good things of material
existence. The luxuriant harvests of cereals that waved on
every field from the shores of the Rhine to the banks of the
Nile, the vines that festooned the hillsides of Syria, of Italy,
and of Greece, the olives of Spain, the fruits of the gardens of
the Hesperides, the domestic quadrupeds and fowls known in
ancient rural husbandry&mdash;all these were original products of
foreign climes, naturalized in new homes, and gradually ennobled
by the art of man, while centuries of persevering labor
were expelling the wild vegetation, and fitting the earth for
the production of more generous growths.</p>

<p>Only for the sense of landscape beauty did unaided nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
make provision. Indeed, the very commonness of this source
of refined enjoyment seems to have deprived it of half its
value; and it was only in the infancy of lands where all the
earth was fair, that Greek and Roman humanity had sympathy
enough with the inanimate world to be alive to the
charms of rural and of mountain scenery. In later generations,
when the glories of the landscape had been heightened
by plantation, and decorative architecture, and other forms of
picturesque improvement, the poets of Greece and Rome were
blinded by excess of light, and became, at last, almost insensible
to beauties that now, even in their degraded state, enchant
every eye, except, too often, those which a lifelong familiarity
has dulled to their attractions.</p>


<h4><i>Physical Decay of the Territory of the Roman Empire, and
of other parts of the Old World.</i></h4>

<p>If we compare the present physical condition of the countries
of which I am speaking, with the descriptions that ancient
historians and geographers have given of their fertility and
general capability of ministering to human uses, we shall find
that more than one half of their whole extent&mdash;including the
provinces most celebrated for the profusion and variety of
their spontaneous and their cultivated products, and for the
wealth and social advancement of their inhabitants&mdash;is either
deserted by civilized man and surrendered to hopeless desolation,
or at least greatly reduced in both productiveness and
population. Vast forests have disappeared from mountain
spurs and ridges; the vegetable earth accumulated beneath the
trees by the decay of leaves and fallen trunks, the soil of the
alpine pastures which skirted and indented the woods, and the
mould of the upland fields, are washed away; meadows, once
fertilized by irrigation, are waste and unproductive, because
the cisterns and reservoirs that supplied the ancient canals are
broken, or the springs that fed them dried up; rivers famous
in history and song have shrunk to humble brooklets; the
willows that ornamented and protected the banks of the lesser<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
watercourses are gone, and the rivulets have ceased to exist as
perennial currents, because the little water that finds its way
into their old channels is evaporated by the droughts of summer,
or absorbed by the parched earth, before it reaches the
lowlands; the beds of the brooks have widened into broad
expanses of pebbles and gravel, over which, though in the hot
season passed dryshod, in winter sealike torrents thunder;
the entrances of navigable streams are obstructed by sandbars,
and harbors, once marts of an extensive commerce, are
shoaled by the deposits of the rivers at whose mouths they
lie; the elevation of the beds of estuaries, and the consequently
diminished velocity of the streams which flow into
them, have converted thousands of leagues of shallow sea and
fertile lowland into unproductive and miasmatic morasses.</p>

<p>Besides the direct testimony of history to the ancient fertility
of the regions to which I refer&mdash;Northern Africa, the
greater Arabian peninsula, Syria, Mesopotamia, Armenia and
many other provinces of Asia Minor, Greece, Sicily, and parts
of even Italy and Spain&mdash;the multitude and extent of yet
remaining architectural ruins, and of decayed works of internal
improvement, show that at former epochs a dense population
inhabited those now lonely districts. Such a population
could have been sustained only by a productiveness of soil of
which we at present discover but slender traces; and the
abundance derived from that fertility serves to explain how
large armies, like those of the ancient Persians, and of the Crusaders
and the Tartars in later ages, could, without an organized
commissariat, secure adequate supplies in long marches
through territories which, in our times, would scarcely afford
forage for a single regiment.</p>

<p>It appears, then, that the fairest and fruitfulest provinces
of the Roman Empire, precisely that portion of terrestrial surface,
in short, which, about the commencement of the Christian
era, was endowed with the greatest superiority of soil,
climate, and position, which had been carried to the highest
pitch of physical improvement, and which thus combined the
natural and artificial conditions best fitting it for the habita<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>tion
and enjoyment of a dense and highly refined and cultivated
population, is now completely exhausted of its fertility, or so
diminished in productiveness, as, with the exception of a few
favored oases that have escaped the general ruin, to be no
longer capable of affording sustenance to civilized man. If
to this realm of desolation we add the now wasted and solitary
soils of Persia and the remoter East, that once fed their
millions with milk and honey, we shall see that a territory
larger than all Europe, the abundance of which sustained in
bygone centuries a population scarcely inferior to that of the
whole Christian world at the present day, has been entirely
withdrawn from human use, or, at best, is thinly inhabited by
tribes too few in numbers, too poor in superfluous products,
and too little advanced in culture and the social arts, to contribute
anything to the general moral or material interests of
the great commonwealth of man.</p>


<h4><i>Causes of this Decay.</i></h4>

<p>The decay of these once flourishing countries is partly due,
no doubt, to that class of geological causes, whose action we
can neither resist nor guide, and partly also to the direct violence
of hostile human force; but it is, in a far greater proportion,
either the result of man's ignorant disregard of the laws
of nature, or an incidental consequence of war, and of civil and
ecclesiastical tyranny and misrule. Next to ignorance of these
laws, the primitive source, the <i>causa causarum</i>, of the acts and
neglects which have blasted with sterility and physical decrepitude
the noblest half of the empire of the C&aelig;sars, is, first, the
brutal and exhausting despotism which Rome herself exercised
over her conquered kingdoms, and even over her Italian territory;
then, the host of temporal and spiritual tyrannies which
she left as her dying curse to all her wide dominion, and
which, in some form of violence or of fraud, still brood over
almost every soil subdued by the Roman legions.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Man can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>not
struggle at once against crushing oppression and the
destructive forces of inorganic nature. When both are combined
against him, he succumbs after a shorter or a longer
struggle, and the fields he has won from the primeval wood
relapse into their original state of wild and luxuriant, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
unprofitable forest growth, or fall into that of a dry and barren
wilderness.</p>

<p>Rome imposed on the products of agricultural labor in the
rural districts taxes which the sale of the entire harvest would
scarcely discharge; she drained them of their population by
military conscription; she impoverished the peasantry by
forced and unpaid labor on public works; she hampered
industry and internal commerce by absurd restrictions and
unwise regulations. Hence, large tracts of land were left
uncultivated, or altogether deserted, and exposed to all the
destructive forces which act with such energy on the surface
of the earth when it is deprived of those protections by which
nature originally guarded it, and for which, in well-ordered
husbandry, human ingenuity has contrived more or less efficient
substitutes.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Similar abuses have tended to perpetuate
and extend these evils in later ages, and it is but recently that,
even in the most populous parts of Europe, public attention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
has been half awakened to the necessity of restoring the disturbed
harmonies of nature, whose well-balanced influences
are so propitious to all her organic offspring, of repaying to
our great mother the debt which the prodigality and the thriftlessness
of former generations have imposed upon their successors&mdash;thus
fulfilling the command of religion and of practical
wisdom, to use this world as not abusing it.</p>


<h4><i>New School of Geographers.</i></h4>

<p>The labors of Humboldt, of Ritter, of Guyot and their
followers, have given to the science of geography a more
philosophical, and, at the same time, a more imaginative character
than it had received from the hands of their predecessors.
Perhaps the most interesting field of speculation, thrown open
by the new school to the cultivators of this attractive study, is
the inquiry: how far external physical conditions, and especially
the configuration of the earth's surface, and the distribution,
outline, and relative position of land and water, have
influenced the social life and social progress of man.</p>


<h4><i>Reaction of Man on Nature.</i></h4>

<p>But, as we have seen, man has reacted upon organized and
inorganic nature, and thereby modified, if not determined, the
material structure of his earthly home. The measure of that
reaction manifestly constitutes a very important element in the
appreciation of the relations between mind and matter, as well
as in the discussion of many purely physical problems. But
though the subject has been incidentally touched upon by
many geographers, and treated with much fulness of detail in
regard to certain limited fields of human effort, and to certain
specific effects of human action, it has not, as a whole, so far
as I know, been made matter of special observation, or of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>torical
research by any scientific inquirer.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Indeed, until the
influence of physical geography upon human life was recognized
as a distinct branch of philosophical investigation, there
was no motive for the pursuit of such speculations; and it was
desirable to inquire whether we have or can become the architects
of our own abiding place, only when it was known how
the mode of our physical, moral, and intellectual being is
affected by the character of the home which Providence has
appointed, and we have fashioned, for our material habitation.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It is still too early to attempt scientific method in discussing
this problem, nor is our present store of the necessary facts
by any means complete enough to warrant me in promising
any approach to fulness of statement respecting them. Systematic
observation in relation to this subject has hardly yet
begun,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and the scattered data which have chanced to be
recorded have never been collected. It has now no place in
the general scheme of physical science, and is matter of sug<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>gestion
and speculation only, not of established and positive
conclusion. At present, then, all that I can hope is to excite
an interest in a topic of much economical importance, by
pointing out the directions and illustrating the modes in
which human action has been or may be most injurious or
most beneficial in its influence upon the physical conditions of
the earth we inhabit.</p>


<h4><i>Observation of Nature.</i></h4>

<p>In these pages, as in all I have ever written or propose to
write, it is my aim to stimulate, not to satisfy, curiosity, and it
is no part of my object to save my readers the labor of observation
or of thought. For labor is life, and</p>

<p class="poem">
Death lives where power lives unused.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Self is the schoolmaster whose lessons are best worth his
wages; and since the subject I am considering has not yet
become a branch of formal instruction, those whom it may
interest can, fortunately, have no pedagogue but themselves.
To the natural philosopher, the descriptive poet, the painter,
and the sculptor, as well as to the common observer, the power
most important to cultivate, and, at the same time, hardest to
acquire, is that of seeing what is before him. Sight is a faculty;
seeing, an art. The eye is a physical, but not a self-acting
apparatus, and in general it sees only what it seeks.
Like a mirror, it reflects objects presented to it; but it may be
as insensible as a mirror, and it does not necessarily perceive
what it reflects.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It is disputed whether the purely material<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
sensibility of the eye is capable of improvement and cultivation.
It has been maintained by high authority, that the natural
acuteness of none of our sensuous faculties can be heightened
by use, and hence that the minutest details of the image
formed on the retina are as perfect in the most untrained, as
in the most thoroughly disciplined organ. This may well be
doubted, and it is agreed on all hands that the power of multifarious
perception and rapid discrimination may be immensely
increased by well-directed practice.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This exercise of the eye<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
I desire to promote, and, next to moral and religious doctrine,
I know no more important practical lessons in this earthly life
of ours&mdash;which, to the wise man, is a school from the cradle to
the grave&mdash;than those relating to the employment of the sense
of vision in the study of nature.</p>

<p>The pursuit of physical geography, embracing actual observation
of terrestrial surface, affords to the eye the best general
training that is accessible to all. The majority of even cultivated
men have not the time and means of acquiring anything
beyond a very superficial acquaintance with any branch of
physical knowledge. Natural science has become so vastly
extended, its recorded facts and its unanswered questions so
immensely multiplied, that every strictly scientific man must
be a specialist, and confine the researches of a whole life within
a comparatively narrow circle. The study I am recommending,
in the view I propose to take of it, is yet in that imperfectly
developed state which allows its votaries to occupy
themselves with such broad and general views as are attainable
by every person of culture, and it does not now require a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
knowledge of special details which only years of application
can master. It may be profitably pursued by all; and every
traveller, every lover of rural scenery, every agriculturist, who
will wisely use the gift of sight, may add valuable contributions
to the common stock of knowledge on a subject which,
as I hope to convince my readers, though long neglected, and
now inartificially presented, is not only a very important, but
a very interesting field of inquiry.</p>


<h4><i>Cosmical and Geological Influences.</i></h4>

<p>The revolutions of the seasons, with their alternations of
temperature and of length of day and night, the climates of
different zones, and the general condition and movements of
the atmosphere and the seas, depend upon causes for the most
part cosmical, and, of course, wholly beyond our control. The
elevation, configuration, and composition of the great masses
of terrestrial surface, and the relative extent and distribution
of land and water, are determined by geological influences
equally remote from our jurisdiction. It would hence seem
that the physical adaptation of different portions of the earth
to the use and enjoyment of man is a matter so strictly belonging
to mightier than human powers, that we can only accept
geographical nature as we find her, and be content with such
soils and such skies as she spontaneously offers.</p>


<h4><i>Geographical Influence of Man.</i></h4>

<p>But it is certain that man has done much to mould the
form of the earth's surface, though we cannot always distinguish
between the results of his action and the effects of
purely geological causes; that the destruction of the forests,
the drainage of lakes and marshes, and the operations of rural
husbandry and industrial art have tended to produce great
changes in the hygrometric, thermometric, electric, and chemical
condition of the atmosphere, though we are not yet able to
measure the force of the different elements of disturbance, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
to say how far they have been compensated by each other, or
by still obscurer influences; and, finally, that the myriad
forms of animal and vegetable life, which covered the earth
when man first entered upon the theatre of a nature whose
harmonies he was destined to derange, have been, through his
action, greatly changed in numerical proportion, sometimes
much modified in form and product, and sometimes entirely
extirpated.</p>

<p>The physical revolutions thus wrought by man have not
all been destructive to human interests. Soils to which no
nutritious vegetable was indigenous, countries which once
brought forth but the fewest products suited for the sustenance
and comfort of man&mdash;while the severity of their climates created
and stimulated the greatest number and the most imperious
urgency of physical wants&mdash;surfaces the most rugged
and intractable, and least blessed with natural facilities of communication,
have been made in modern times to yield and
distribute all that supplies the material necessities, all that
contributes to the sensuous enjoyments and conveniences of
civilized life. The Scythia, the Thule, the Britain, the Germany,
and the Gaul which the Roman writers describe in such
forbidding terms, have been brought almost to rival the native
luxuriance and easily won plenty of Southern Italy; and,
while the fountains of oil and wine that refreshed old Greece
and Syria and Northern Africa have almost ceased to flow,
and the soils of those fair lands are turned to thirsty and inhospitable
deserts, the hyperborean regions of Europe have conquered,
or rather compensated, the rigors of climate, and
attained to a material wealth and variety of product that,
with all their natural advantages, the granaries of the ancient
world can hardly be said to have enjoyed.</p>

<p>These changes for evil and for good have not been caused
by great natural revolutions of the globe, nor are they by any
means attributable wholly to the moral and physical action or
inaction of the peoples, or, in all cases, even of the races that
now inhabit these respective regions. They are products of a
complication of conflicting or coincident forces, acting through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
a long series of generations; here, improvidence, wastefulness,
and wanton violence; there, foresight and wisely guided persevering
industry. So far as they are purely the calculated
and desired results of those simple and familiar operations of
agriculture and of social life which are as universal as civilization&mdash;the
removal of the forests which covered the soil
required for the cultivation of edible fruits, the drying of here
and there a few acres too moist for profitable husbandry, by
draining off the surface waters, the substitution of domesticated
and nutritious for wild and unprofitable vegetable
growths, the construction of roads and canals and artificial
harbors&mdash;they belong to the sphere of rural, commercial, and
political economy more properly than to geography, and
hence are but incidentally embraced within the range of our
present inquiries, which concern physical, not financial balances.
I propose to examine only the greater, more permanent,
and more comprehensive mutations which man has produced,
and is producing, in earth, sea, and sky, sometimes,
indeed, with conscious purpose, but for the most part, as
unforeseen though natural consequences of acts performed for
narrower and more immediate ends.</p>

<p>The exact measurement of the geographical changes hitherto
thus effected is, as I have hinted, impracticable, and we
possess, in relation to them, the means of only qualitative, not
quantitative analysis. The fact of such revolutions is established
partly by historical evidence, partly by analogical
deduction from effects produced in our own time by operations
similar in character to those which must have taken
place in more or less remote ages of human action. Both
sources of information are alike defective in precision; the
latter, for general reasons too obvious to require specification;
the former, because the facts to which it bears testimony
occurred before the habit or the means of rigorously scientific
observation upon any branch of physical research, and especially
upon climatic changes, existed.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Uncertainty of our Meteorological Knowledge.</i></h4>

<p>The invention of measures of heat, and of atmospheric
moisture, pressure, and precipitation, is extremely recent.
Hence, ancient physicists have left us no thermometric or
barometric records, no tables of the fall, evaporation, and flow
of waters, and even no accurate maps of coast lines and the
course of rivers. Their notices of these phenomena are almost
wholly confined to excessive and exceptional instances of high
or of low temperatures, extraordinary falls of rain and snow,
and unusual floods or droughts. Our knowledge of the
meteorological condition of the earth, at any period more than
two centuries before our own time, is derived from these
imperfect details, from the vague statements of ancient historians
and geographers in regard to the volume of rivers and
the relative extent of forest and cultivated land, from the indications
furnished by the history of the agriculture and rural
economy of past generations, and from other almost purely
casual sources of information.</p>

<p>Among these latter we must rank certain newly laid open
fields of investigation, from which facts bearing on the point
now under consideration have been gathered. I allude to the
discovery of artificial objects in geological formations older
than any hitherto recognized as exhibiting traces of the existence
of man; to the ancient lacustrine habitations of Switzerland,
containing the implements of the occupants, remains of
their food, and other relics of human life; to the curious revelations
of the Kj&ouml;kkenm&ouml;ddinger, or heaps of kitchen refuse,
in Denmark, and of the peat mosses in the same and other
northern countries; to the dwellings and other evidences of
the industry of man in remote ages sometimes laid bare by
the movement of sand dunes on the coasts of France and of
the North Sea; and to the facts disclosed on the shores of the
latter, by excavations in inhabited mounds which were, perhaps,
raised before the period of the Roman Empire. These
remains are memorials of races which have left no written
records, because they perished before the historical period of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the countries they occupied began. The plants and animals
that furnished the relics found in the deposits were certainly
contemporaneous with man; for they are associated with his
works, and have evidently served his uses. In some cases, the
animals belonged to species well ascertained to be now altogether
extinct; in some others, both the animals and the
vegetables, though extant elsewhere, have ceased to inhabit
the regions where their remains are discovered. From the
character of the artificial objects, as compared with others
belonging to known dates, or at least to known periods of
civilization, ingenious inferences have been drawn as to their
age; and from the vegetation, remains of which accompany
them, as to the climates of Central and Northern Europe at
the time of their production.</p>

<p>There are, however, sources of error which have not always
been sufficiently guarded against in making these estimates.
When a boat, composed of several pieces of wood fastened
together by pins of the same material, is dug out of a bog, it
is inferred that the vessel, and the skeletons and implements
found with it, belong to an age when the use of iron was not
known to the builders. But this conclusion is not warranted
by the simple fact that metals were not employed in its construction;
for the Nubians at this day build boats large enough
to carry half a dozen persons across the Nile, out of small
pieces of acacia wood pinned together entirely with wooden
bolts. Nor is the occurrence of flint arrow heads and knives,
in conjunction with other evidences of human life, conclusive
proof as to the antiquity of the latter. Lyell informs us that
some Oriental tribes still continue to use the same stone implements
as their ancestors, "after that mighty empires, where
the use of metals in the arts was well known, had flourished
for three thousand years in their neighborhood;"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and the
North American Indians now manufacture and use weapons
of stone, and even of glass, chipping them in the latter case
out of the bottoms of thick bottles, with great facility.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>We may also be misled by our ignorance of the commercial
relations existing between savage tribes. Extremely rude
nations, in spite of their jealousies and their perpetual wars,
sometimes contrive to exchange the products of provinces very
widely separated from each other. The mounds of Ohio contain
pearls, thought to be marine, which must have come from
the Gulf of Mexico, or perhaps even from California, and the
knives and pipes found in the same graves are often formed of
far-fetched material, that was naturally paid for by some home
product exported to the locality whence the material was
derived. The art of preserving fish, flesh, and fowl by drying
and smoking is widely diffused, and of great antiquity. The
Indians of Long Island Sound are said to have carried on a
trade in dried shell fish with tribes residing very far inland.
From the earliest ages, the inhabitants of the Faroe and
Orkney Islands, and of the opposite mainland coasts, have
smoked wild fowl and other flesh. Hence it is possible that
the animal and the vegetable food, the remains of which are
found in the ancient deposits I am speaking of, may sometimes
have been brought from climates remote from that where it
was consumed.</p>

<p>The most important, as well as the most trustworthy con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>clusions
with respect to the climate of ancient Europe and
Asia, are those drawn from the accounts given by the classical
writers of the growth of cultivated plants; but these are by
no means free from uncertainty, because we can seldom be
sure of an identity of species, almost never of an identity of
race or variety, between vegetables known to the agriculturists
of Greece and Rome and those of modern times which are
thought most nearly to resemble them. Besides this, there is
always room for doubt whether the habits of plants long
grown in different countries may not have been so changed
by domestication that the conditions of temperature and
humidity which they required twenty centuries ago were
different from those at present demanded for their advantageous
cultivation.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>Even if we suppose an identity of species, of race, and of
habit to be established between a given ancient and modern
plant, the negative fact that the latter will not grow now
where it flourished two thousand years ago does not in all
cases prove a change of climate. The same result might
follow from the exhaustion of the soil,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> or from a change in
the quantity of moisture it habitually contains. After a district
of country has been completely or even partially cleared
of its forest growth, and brought under cultivation, the drying
of the soil, under favorable circumstances, goes on for generations,
perhaps for ages.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> In other cases, from injudicious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
husbandry, or the diversion or choking up of natural watercourses,
it may become more highly charged with humidity.
An increase or diminution of the moisture of a soil almost
necessarily supposes an elevation or a depression of its winter
or its summer heat, and of its extreme, if not of its mean
annual temperature, though such elevation or depression may
be so slight as not sensibly to raise or lower the mercury in a
thermometer exposed to the open air. Any of these causes,
more or less humidity, or more or less warmth of soil, would
affect the growth both of wild and of cultivated vegetation,
and consequently, without any appreciable change in atmospheric
temperature, precipitation, or evaporation, plants of a
particular species might cease to be advantageously cultivated
where they had once been easily reared.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
We are very imperfectly acquainted with the present mean
and extreme temperature, or the precipitation and the evaporation
of any extensive region, even in countries most densely
peopled and best supplied with instruments and observers.
The progress of science is constantly detecting errors of method
in older observations, and many laboriously constructed tables
of meteorological phenomena are now thrown aside as fallacious,
and therefore worse than useless, because some condition
necessary to secure accuracy of result was neglected, in obtaining
the data on which they were founded.</p>

<p>To take a familiar instance: it is but recently that attention
has been drawn to the great influence of slight changes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
station upon the results of observations of temperature and
precipitation. A thermometer removed but a few hundred
yards from its first position differs not unfrequently five, sometimes
even ten degrees in its readings; and when we are told
that the annual fall of rain on the roof of the observatory at
Paris is two inches less than on the ground by the side of it,
we may see that the level of the rain-gauge is a point of much
consequence in making estimates from its measurements. The
data from which results have been deduced with respect to
the hygrometrical and thermometrical conditions, the climate
in short, of different countries, have very often been derived
from observations at single points in cities or districts separated
by considerable distances. The tendency of errors and accidents
to balance each other authorizes us, indeed, to entertain
greater confidence than we could otherwise feel in the conclusions
drawn from such tables; but it is in the highest degree
probable that they would be much modified by more numerous
series of observations, at different stations within narrow
limits.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>There is one branch of research which is of the utmost
importance in reference to these questions, but which, from
the great difficulty of direct observation upon it, has been less
successfully studied than almost any other problem of physical
science. I refer to the proportions between precipitation,
superficial drainage, absorption, and evaporation. Precise
actual measurement of these quantities upon even a single acre
of ground is impossible; and in all cabinet experiments on the
subject, the conditions of the surface observed are so different
from those which occur in nature, that we cannot safely reason
from one case to the other. In nature, the inclination of the
ground, the degree of freedom or obstruction of the surface,
the composition and density of the soil, upon which its permeability
by water and its power of absorbing and retaining or
transmitting moisture depend, its temperature, the dryness or
saturation of the subsoil, vary at comparatively short distances;
and though the precipitation upon and the superficial flow
from very small geographical basins may be estimated with an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
approach to precision, yet even here we have no present means
of knowing how much of the water absorbed by the earth is
restored to the atmosphere by evaporation, and how much
carried off by infiltration or other modes of underground
discharge. When, therefore, we attempt to use the phenomena
observed on a few square or cubic yards of earth, as a
basis of reasoning upon the meteorology of a province, it is
evident that our data must be insufficient to warrant positive
general conclusions. In discussing the climatology of whole
countries, or even of comparatively small local divisions, we
may safely say that none can tell what percentage of the
water they receive from the atmosphere is evaporated; what
absorbed by the ground and conveyed off by subterranean
conduits; what carried down to the sea by superficial channels;
what drawn from the earth or the air by a given extent
of forest, of short pasture vegetation, or of tall meadow-grass;
what given out again by surfaces so covered, or by bare
ground of various textures and composition, under different
conditions of atmospheric temperature, pressure, and humidity;
or what is the amount of evaporation from water, ice, or
snow, under the varying exposures to which, in actual nature,
they are constantly subjected. If, then, we are so ignorant of
all these climatic phenomena in the best-known regions inhabited
by man, it is evident that we can rely little upon theoretical
deductions applied to the former more natural state of
the same regions&mdash;less still to such as are adopted with respect
to distant, strange, and primitive countries.</p>


<h4><i>Mechanical Effects produced by Man on the Surface of the
Earth more easily ascertainable.</i></h4>

<p>In investigating the mechanical effects of human action on
superficial geography, we are treading on safer ground, and
dealing with much less subtile phenomena, less intractable
elements. Great physical changes can, in some cases, be positively
shown, in some almost certainly inferred, to have been
produced by the operations of rural industry, and by the labors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of man in other spheres of material effort; and hence, in this
most important part of our subject, we can arrive at many
positive generalizations, and obtain practical results of no
small economical value.</p>


<h4><i>Importance and Possibility of Physical Restoration.</i></h4>

<p>Many circumstances conspire to invest with great present
interest the questions: how far man can permanently modify
and ameliorate those physical conditions of terrestrial surface
and climate on which his material welfare depends; how far
he can compensate, arrest, or retard the deterioration which
many of his agricultural and industrial processes tend to produce;
and how far he can restore fertility and salubrity to soils
which his follies or his crimes have made barren or pestilential.
Among these circumstances, the most prominent, perhaps, is
the necessity of providing new homes for a European population
which is increasing more rapidly than its means of subsistence,
new physical comforts for classes of the people that have
now become too much enlightened and have imbibed too
much culture to submit to a longer deprivation of a share in
the material enjoyments which the privileged ranks have hitherto
monopolized.</p>

<p>To supply new hives for the emigrant swarms, there are,
first, the vast unoccupied prairies and forests of America,
of Australia, and of many other great oceanic islands, the
sparsely inhabited and still unexhausted soils of Southern and
even Central Africa, and, finally, the impoverished and half-depopulated
shores of the Mediterranean, and the interior of
Asia Minor and the farther East. To furnish to those who
shall remain after emigration shall have conveniently reduced
the too dense population of many European states, those
means of sensuous and of intellectual well-being which are
styled "artificial wants" when demanded by the humble and
the poor, but are admitted to be "necessaries" when claimed
by the noble and the rich, the soil must be stimulated to its
highest powers of production, and man's utmost ingenuity and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
energy must be tasked to renovate a nature drained, by his
improvidence, of fountains which a wise economy would have
made plenteous and perennial sources of beauty, health, and
wealth.</p>

<p>In those yet virgin lands which the progress of modern
discovery in both hemispheres has brought and is still bringing
to the knowledge and control of civilized man, not much
improvement of great physical conditions is to be looked for.
The proportion of forest is indeed to be considerably reduced,
superfluous waters to be drawn off, and routes of internal
communication to be constructed; but the primitive geographical
and climatic features of these countries ought to be, as far
as possible, retained.</p>

<h4><i>Stability of Nature.</i></h4>

<p>Nature, left undisturbed, so fashions her territory as to give
it almost unchanging permanence of form, outline, and proportion,
except when shattered by geologic convulsions; and
in these comparatively rare cases of derangement, she sets
herself at once to repair the superficial damage, and to restore,
as nearly as practicable, the former aspect of her dominion.
In new countries, the natural inclination of the ground, the
self-formed slopes and levels, are generally such as best secure
the stability of the soil. They have been graded and lowered
or elevated by frost and chemical forces and gravitation and
the flow of water and vegetable deposit and the action of
the winds, until, by a general compensation of conflicting
forces, a condition of equilibrium has been reached which,
without the action of man, would remain, with little fluctuation,
for countless ages.</p>

<p>We need not go far back to reach a period when, in all
that portion of the North American continent which has been
occupied by British colonization, the geographical elements
very nearly balanced and compensated each other. At the
commencement of the seventeenth century, the soil, with
insignificant exceptions, was covered with forests;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
whenever the Indian, in consequence of war or the exhaustion
of the beasts of the chase, abandoned the narrow fields he had
planted and the woods he had burned over, they speedily
returned, by a succession of herbaceous, arborescent, and arboreal
growths, to their original state. Even a single generation
sufficed to restore them almost to their primitive luxuriance
of forest vegetation.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The unbroken forests had attained to
their maximum density and strength of growth, and, as the
older trees decayed and fell, they were succeeded by new
shoots or seedlings, so that from century to century no perceptible
change seems to have occurred in the wood, except
the slow, spontaneous succession of crops. This succession
involved no interruption of growth, and but little break in
the "boundless contiguity of shade;" for, in the husbandry
of nature, there are no fallows. Trees fall singly, not by
square roods, and the tall pine is hardly prostrate, before the
light and heat, admitted to the ground by the removal of the
dense crown of foliage which had shut them out, stimulate the
germination of the seeds of broad-leaved trees that had lain,
waiting this kindly influence, perhaps for centuries. Two
natural causes, destructive in character, were, indeed, in
operation in the primitive American forests, though, in the
Northern colonies, at least, there were sufficient compensations;
for we do not discover that any considerable permanent
change was produced by them. I refer to the action of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
beavers and of fallen trees in producing bogs,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and of smaller
animals, insects, and birds, in destroying the woods. Bogs
are less numerous and extensive in the Northern States of the
American union, because the natural inclination of the surface
favors drainage; but they are more frequent, and cover more
ground, in the Southern States, for the opposite reason.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
They generally originate in the checking of watercourses by
the falling of timber, or of earth and rocks, across their channels.
If the impediment thus created is sufficient to retain a
permanent accumulation of water behind it, the trees whose
roots are overflowed soon perish, and then by their fall
increase the obstruction, and, of course, occasion a still wider
spread of the stagnating stream. This process goes on until
the water finds a new outlet, at a higher level, not liable to
similar interruption. The fallen trees not completely covered
by water are soon overgrown with mosses; aquatic and semi-aquatic
plants propagate themselves, and spread until they
more or less completely fill up the space occupied by the
water, and the surface is gradually converted from a pond to a
quaking morass.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The morass is slowly solidified by vegetable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
production and deposit, then very often restored to the forest
condition by the growth of black ashes, cedars, or, in southern
latitudes, cypresses, and other trees suited to such a soil, and
thus the interrupted harmony of nature is at last re&euml;stablished.</p>

<p>I am disposed to think that more bogs in the Northern
States owe their origin to beavers than to accidental obstructions
of rivulets by wind-fallen or naturally decayed trees; for
there are few swamps in those States, at the outlets of which
we may not, by careful search, find the remains of a beaver
dam. The beaver sometimes inhabits natural lakelets, but he
prefers to owe his pond to his own ingenuity and toil. The
reservoir once constructed, its inhabitants rapidly multiply,
and as its harvests of pond lilies, and other aquatic plants on
which this quadruped feeds in winter, become too small for
the growing population, the beaver metropolis sends out
expeditions of discovery and colonization. The pond gradually
fills up, by the operation of the same causes as when it
owes its existence to an accidental obstruction, and when, at
last, the original settlement is converted into a bog by the
usual processes of vegetable life, the remaining inhabitants
abandon it and build on some virgin brooklet a new city of
the waters.</p>

<p>In countries somewhat further advanced in civilization
than those occupied by the North American Indians, as in
medi&aelig;val Ireland, the formation of bogs may be commenced
by the neglect of man to remove, from the natural channels
of superficial drainage, the tops and branches of trees felled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
for the various purposes to which wood is applicable in his
rude industry; and, when the flow of the water is thus
checked, nature goes on with the processes I have already
described. In such half-civilized regions, too, windfalls are
more frequent than in those where the forest is unbroken,
because, when openings have been made in it, for agricultural
or other purposes, the entrance thus afforded to the wind
occasions the sudden overthrow of hundreds of trees which
might otherwise have stood for generations, and thus have
fallen to the ground, only one by one, as natural decay
brought them down.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Besides this, the flocks bred by man in
the pastoral state, keep down the incipient growth of trees on
the half-dried bogs, and prevent them from recovering their
primitive condition.</p>

<p>Young trees in the native forest are sometimes girdled and
killed by the smaller rodent quadrupeds, and their growth is
checked by birds which feed on the terminal bud; but these
animals, as we shall see, are generally found on the skirts of
the wood only, not in its deeper recesses, and hence the mischief
they do is not extensive. The insects which damage
primitive forests by feeding upon products of trees essential to
their growth, are not numerous, nor is their appearance, in
destructive numbers, frequent; and those which perforate the
stems and branches, to deposit and hatch their eggs, more
commonly select dead trees for that purpose, though, unhappily,
there are important exceptions to this latter remark.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
do not know that we have any evidence of the destruction or
serious injury of American forests by insects, before or even
soon after the period of colonization; but since the white man
has laid bare a vast proportion of the earth's surface, and
thereby produced changes favorable, perhaps, to the multiplication
of these pests, they have greatly increased in numbers,
and, apparently, in voracity also. Not many years ago, the
pines on thousands of acres of land in North Carolina, were
destroyed by insects not known to have ever done serious
injury to that tree before. In such cases as this and others of
the like sort, there is good reason to believe that man is the
indirect cause of an evil for which he pays so heavy a penalty.
Insects increase whenever the birds which feed upon them
disappear. Hence, in the wanton destruction of the robin and
other insectivorous birds, the <i>bipes implumis</i>, the featherless
biped, man, is not only exchanging the vocal orchestra which
greets the rising sun for the drowsy beetle's evening drone,
and depriving his groves and his fields of their fairest ornament,
but he is waging a treacherous warfare on his natural
allies.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>In fine, in countries untrodden by man, the proportions
and relative positions of land and water, the atmospheric
precipitation and evaporation, the thermometric mean, and
the distribution of vegetable and animal life, are subject to
change only from geological influences so slow in their operation
that the geographical conditions may be regarded as
constant and immutable. These arrangements of nature it is,
in most cases, highly desirable substantially to maintain, when
such regions become the seat of organized commonwealths.
It is, therefore, a matter of the first importance, that, in
commencing the process of fitting them for permanent civilized
occupation, the transforming operations should be so conducted
as not unnecessarily to derange and destroy what, in too
many cases, it is beyond the power of man to rectify or restore.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Restoration of Disturbed Harmonies.</i></h4>

<p>In reclaiming and reoccupying lands laid waste by human
improvidence or malice, and abandoned by man, or occupied
only by a nomade or thinly scattered population, the task of
the pioneer settler is of a very different character. He is to
become a co-worker with nature in the reconstruction of the
damaged fabric which the negligence or the wantonness of
former lodgers has rendered untenantable. He must aid her
in reclothing the mountain slopes with forests and vegetable
mould, thereby restoring the fountains which she provided to
water them; in checking the devastating fury of torrents, and
bringing back the surface drainage to its primitive narrow
channels; and in drying deadly morasses by opening the
natural sluices which have been choked up, and cutting new
canals for drawing off their stagnant waters. He must thus,
on the one hand, create new reservoirs, and, on the other,
remove mischievous accumulations of moisture, thereby equalizing
and regulating the sources of atmospheric humidity and
of flowing water, both which are so essential to all vegetable
growth, and, of course, to human and lower animal life.</p>


<h4><i>Destructiveness of Man.</i></h4>

<p>Man has too long forgotten that the earth was given to
him for usufruct alone, not for consumption, still less for profligate
waste. Nature has provided against the absolute destruction
of any of her elementary matter, the raw material of her
works; the thunderbolt and the tornado, the most convulsive
throes of even the volcano and the earthquake, being only
phenomena of decomposition and recomposition. But she has
left it within the power of man irreparably to derange the
combinations of inorganic matter and of organic life, which
through the night of &aelig;ons she had been proportioning and
balancing, to prepare the earth for his habitation, when, in the
fulness of time, his Creator should call him forth to enter into
its possession.</p>

<p>Apart from the hostile influence of man, the organic and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the inorganic world are, as I have remarked, bound together
by such mutual relations and adaptations as secure, if not the
absolute permanence and equilibrium of both, a long continuance
of the established conditions of each at any given time
and place, or at least, a very slow and gradual succession of
changes in those conditions. But man is everywhere a disturbing
agent. Wherever he plants his foot, the harmonies of
nature are turned to discords. The proportions and accommodations
which insured the stability of existing arrangements
are overthrown. Indigenous vegetable and animal
species are extirpated, and supplanted by others of foreign
origin, spontaneous production is forbidden or restricted, and
the face of the earth is either laid bare or covered with a new
and reluctant growth of vegetable forms, and with alien tribes
of animal life. These intentional changes and substitutions
constitute, indeed, great revolutions; but vast as is their
magnitude and importance, they are, as we shall see, insignificant
in comparison with the contingent and unsought
results which have flowed from them.</p>

<p>The fact that, of all organic beings, man alone is to be
regarded as essentially a destructive power, and that he wields
energies to resist which, nature&mdash;that Nature whom all
material life and all inorganic substance obey&mdash;is wholly
impotent, tends to prove that, though living in physical
nature, he is not of her, that he is of more exalted parentage,
and belongs to a higher order of existences than those born of
her womb and submissive to her dictates.</p>

<p>There are, indeed, brute destroyers, beasts and birds and
insects of prey&mdash;all animal life feeds upon, and, of course,
destroys other life,&mdash;but this destruction is balanced by compensations.
It is, in fact, the very means by which the existence
of one tribe of animals or of vegetables is secured against
being smothered by the encroachments of another; and the
reproductive powers of species, which serve as the food of
others, are always proportioned to the demand they are
destined to supply. Man pursues his victims with reckless
destructiveness; and, while the sacrifice of life by the lower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
animals is limited by the cravings of appetite, he unsparingly
persecutes, even to extirpation, thousands of organic forms
which he cannot consume.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>The earth was not, in its natural condition, completely
adapted to the use of man, but only to the sustenance of wild
animals and wild vegetation. These live, multiply their kind
in just proportion, and attain their perfect measure of strength
and beauty, without producing or requiring any change in the
natural arrangements of surface, or in each other's spontaneous
tendencies, except such mutual repression of excessive increase
as may prevent the extirpation of one species by the encroachments
of another. In short, without man, lower animal and
spontaneous vegetable life would have been constant in type,
distribution, and proportion, and the physical geography of the
earth would have remained undisturbed for indefinite periods,
and been subject to revolution only from possible, unknown
cosmical causes, or from geological action.</p>

<p>But man, the domestic animals that serve him, the field
and garden plants the products of which supply him with
food and clothing, cannot subsist and rise to the full development
of their higher properties, unless brute and unconscious
nature be effectually combated, and, in a great degree,
vanquished by human art. Hence, a certain measure of transformation
of terrestrial surface, of suppression of natural, and
stimulation of artificially modified productivity becomes necessary.
This measure man has unfortunately exceeded. He has
felled the forests whose network of fibrous roots bound the
mould to the rocky skeleton of the earth; but had he allowed
here and there a belt of woodland to reproduce itself by spontaneous
propagation, most of the mischiefs which his reckless
destruction of the natural protection of the soil has occasioned
would have been averted. He has broken up the mountain
reservoirs, the percolation of whose waters through unseen
channels supplied the fountains that refreshed his cattle and
fertilized his fields; but he has neglected to maintain the
cisterns and the canals of irrigation which a wise antiquity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
had constructed to neutralize the consequences of its own
imprudence. While he has torn the thin glebe which confined
the light earth of extensive plains, and has destroyed the fringe
of semi-aquatic plants which skirted the coast and checked
the drifting of the sea sand, he has failed to prevent the
spreading of the dunes by clothing them with artificially
propagated vegetation. He has ruthlessly warred on all the
tribes of animated nature whose spoil he could convert to his
own uses, and he has not protected the birds which prey on
the insects most destructive to his own harvests.</p>

<p>Purely untutored humanity, it is true, interferes comparatively
little with the arrangements of nature,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and the destruc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>tive
agency of man becomes more and more energetic and
unsparing as he advances in civilization, until the impoverishment,
with which his exhaustion of the natural resources of
the soil is threatening him, at last awakens him to the neces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>sity
of preserving what is left, if not of restoring what has
been wantonly wasted. The wandering savage grows no cultivated
vegetable, fells no forest, and extirpates no useful
plant, no noxious weed. If his skill in the chase enables him
to entrap numbers of the animals on which he feeds, he compensates
this loss by destroying also the lion, the tiger, the
wolf, the otter, the seal, and the eagle, thus indirectly protecting
the feebler quadrupeds and fish and fowls, which would
otherwise become the booty of beasts and birds of prey. But
with stationary life, or rather with the pastoral state, man at
once commences an almost indiscriminate warfare upon all the
forms of animal and vegetable existence around him, and as
he advances in civilization, he gradually eradicates or transforms
every spontaneous product of the soil he occupies.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>


<h4><i>Human and Brute Action Compared.</i></h4>

<p>It has been maintained by authorities as high as any
known to modern science, that the action of man upon
nature, though greater in <i>degree</i>, does not differ in <i>kind</i>, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
that of wild animals. It appears to me to differ in essential
character, because, though it is often followed by unforeseen
and undesired results, yet it is nevertheless guided by a self-conscious
and intelligent will aiming as often at secondary and
remote as at immediate objects. The wild animal, on the
other hand, acts instinctively, and, so far as we are able to
perceive, always with a view to single and direct purposes.
The backwoodsman and the beaver alike fell trees; the man
that he may convert the forest into an olive grove that will
mature its fruit only for a succeeding generation, the beaver
that he may feed upon their bark or use them in the construction
of his habitation. Human differs from brute action, too, in its
influence upon the material world, because it is not controlled
by natural compensations and balances. Natural arrangements,
once disturbed by man, are not restored until he retires
from the field, and leaves free scope to spontaneous recuperative
energies; the wounds he inflicts upon the material creation
are not healed until he withdraws the arm that gave the
blow. On the other hand, I am not aware of any evidence
that wild animals have ever destroyed the smallest forest,
extirpated any organic species or modified its natural character,
occasioned any permanent change of terrestrial surface, or
produced any disturbance of physical conditions which nature
has not, of herself, repaired without the expulsion of the
animal that had caused it.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The form of geographical surface, and very probably the
climate of a given country, depend much on the character of
the vegetable life belonging to it. Man has, by domestication,
greatly changed the habits and properties of the plants he
rears; he has, by voluntary selection, immensely modified the
forms and qualities of the animated creatures that serve him;
and he has, at the same time, completely rooted out many
forms of animal if not of vegetable being.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> What is there, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the influence of brute life, that corresponds to this? We have
no reason to believe that in that portion of the American
continent which, though peopled by many tribes of quadruped
and fowl, remained uninhabited by man, or only thinly occupied
by purely savage tribes, any sensible geographical change
had occurred within twenty centuries before the epoch of
discovery and colonization, while, during the same period,
man had changed millions of square miles, in the fairest and
most fertile regions of the Old World, into the barrenest
deserts.</p>

<p>The ravages committed by man subvert the relations and
destroy the balance which nature had established between her
organized and her inorganic creations; and she avenges herself
upon the intruder, by letting loose upon her defaced
provinces destructive energies hitherto kept in check by
organic forces destined to be his best auxiliaries, but which he
has unwisely dispersed and driven from the field of action.
When the forest is gone, the great reservoir of moisture stored
up in its vegetable mould is evaporated, and returns only in
deluges of rain to wash away the parched dust into which that
mould has been converted. The well-wooded and humid hills
are turned to ridges of dry rock, which encumbers the low
grounds and chokes the watercourses with its debris, and&mdash;except
in countries favored with an equable distribution of
rain through the seasons, and a moderate and regular inclination
of surface&mdash;the whole earth, unless rescued by human art
from the physical degradation to which it tends, becomes an
assemblage of bald mountains, of barren, turfless hills, and of
swampy and malarious plains. There are parts of Asia Minor,
of Northern Africa, of Greece, and even of Alpine Europe,
where the operation of causes set in action by man has
brought the face of the earth to a desolation almost as complete
as that of the moon; and though, within that brief space<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of time which we call "the historical period," they are known
to have been covered with luxuriant woods, verdant pastures,
and fertile meadows, they are now too far deteriorated to be
reclaimable by man, nor can they become again fitted for
human use, except through great geological changes, or other
mysterious influences or agencies of which we have no present
knowledge, and over which we have no prospective control.
The earth is fast becoming an unfit home for its noblest inhabitant,
and another era of equal human crime and human
improvidence, and of like duration with that through which
traces of that crime and that improvidence extend, would
reduce it to such a condition of impoverished productiveness,
of shattered surface, of climatic excess, as to threaten the
depravation, barbarism, and perhaps even extinction of the
species.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>


<h4><i>Physical Improvement.</i></h4>

<p>True, there is a partial reverse to this picture. On narrow
theatres, new forests have been planted; inundations of flowing
streams restrained by heavy walls of masonry and other constructions;
torrents compelled to aid, by depositing the slime
with which they are charged, in filling up lowlands, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
raising the level of morasses which their own overflows had
created; ground submerged by the encroachments of the
ocean, or exposed to be covered by its tides, has been rescued
from its dominion by diking;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> swamps and even lakes have
been drained, and their beds brought within the domain of
agricultural industry; drifting coast dunes have been checked
and made productive by plantation; seas and inland waters
have been repeopled with fish, and even the sands of the
Sahara have been fertilized by artesian fountains. These
achievements are more glorious than the proudest triumphs of
war, but, thus far, they give but faint hope that we shall yet
make full atonement for our spendthrift waste of the bounties
of nature.</p>

<p>It is, on the one hand, rash and unphilosophical to attempt
to set limits to the ultimate power of man over inorganic
nature, and it is unprofitable, on the other, to speculate on
what may be accomplished by the discovery of now unknown
and unimagined natural forces, or even by the invention of
new arts and new processes. But since we have seen aerostation,
the motive power of elastic vapors, the wonders of
modern telegraphy, the destructive explosiveness of gunpowder,
and even of a substance so harmless, unresisting, and
inert as cotton, nothing in the way of mechanical achievement
seems impossible, and it is hard to restrain the imagination
from wandering forward a couple of generations to an epoch
when our descendants shall have advanced as far beyond us in
physical conquest, as we have marched beyond the trophies
erected by our grandfathers.</p>

<p>I must therefore be understood to mean only, that no
agencies now known to man and directed by him seem
adequate to the reducing of great Alpine precipices to such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
slopes as would enable them to support a vegetable clothing,
or to the covering of large extents of denuded rock with earth,
and planting upon them a forest growth. But among the
mysteries which science is yet to reveal, there may be still
undiscovered methods of accomplishing even grander wonders
than these. Mechanical philosophers have suggested the possibility
of accumulating and treasuring up for human use some
of the greater natural forces, which the action of the elements
puts forth with such astonishing energy. Could we gather,
and bind, and make subservient to our control, the power
which a West Indian hurricane exerts through a small area in
one continuous blast, or the momentum expended by the
waves, in a tempestuous winter, upon the breakwater at Cherbourg,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
or the lifting power of the tide, for a month, at the
head of the Bay of Fundy, or the pressure of a square mile of
sea water at the depth of five thousand fathoms, or a moment
of the might of an earthquake or a volcano, our age&mdash;which
moves no mountains and casts them into the sea by faith alone&mdash;might
hope to scarp the rugged walls of the Alps and
Pyrenees and Mount Taurus, robe them once more in a vegetation
as rich as that of their pristine woods, and turn their
wasting torrents into refreshing streams.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>Could this old world, which man has overthrown, be
rebuilded, could human cunning rescue its wasted hillsides
and its deserted plains from solitude or mere nomade occupation,
from barrenness, from nakedness, and from insalubrity,
and restore the ancient fertility and healthfulness of the
Etruscan sea coast, the Campagna and the Pontine marshes,
of Calabria, of Sicily, of the Peloponnesus and insular and
continental Greece, of Asia Minor, of the slopes of Lebanon
and Hermon, of Palestine, of the Syrian desert, of Mesopotamia
and the delta of the Euphrates, of the Cyrenaica, of
Africa proper, Numidia, and Mauritania, the thronging millions
of Europe might still find room on the Eastern continent,
and the main current of emigration be turned toward the
rising instead of the setting sun.</p>

<p>But changes like these must await great political and
moral revolutions in the governments and peoples by whom
those regions are now possessed, a command of pecuniary and
of mechanical means not at present enjoyed by those nations,
and a more advanced and generally diffused knowledge of the
processes by which the amelioration of soil and climate is possible,
than now anywhere exists. Until such circumstances
shall conspire to favor the work of geographical regeneration,
the countries I have mentioned, with here and there a local
exception, will continue to sink into yet deeper desolation, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
in the mean time, the American continent, Southern Africa,
Australia, and the smaller oceanic islands, will be almost the
only theatres where man is engaged, on a great scale, in transforming
the face of nature.</p>


<h4><i>Arrest of Physical Decay of New Countries.</i></h4>

<p>Comparatively short as is the period through which the
colonization of foreign lands by European emigrants extends,
great, and, it is to be feared, sometimes irreparable, injury has
been already done in the various processes by which man
seeks to subjugate the virgin earth; and many provinces, first
trodden by the <i>homo sapiens Europ&aelig;</i> within the last two
centuries, begin to show signs of that melancholy dilapidation
which is now driving so many of the peasantry of Europe
from their native hearths. It is evidently a matter of great
moment, not only to the population of the states where these
symptoms are manifesting themselves, but to the general
interests of humanity, that this decay should be arrested, and
that the future operations of rural husbandry and of forest
industry, in districts yet remaining substantially in their
native condition, should be so conducted as to prevent the
widespread mischiefs which have been elsewhere produced by
thoughtless or wanton destruction of the natural safeguards of
the soil. This can be done only by the diffusion of knowledge
on this subject among the classes that, in earlier days, subdued
and tilled ground in which they had no vested rights, but
who, in our time, own their woods, their pastures, and their
ploughlands as a perpetual possession for them and theirs, and
have, therefore, a strong interest in the protection of their
domain against deterioration.</p>

<h4><i>Forms and Formations most liable to Physical Degradation.</i></h4>

<p>The character and extent of the evils under consideration
depend very much on climate and the natural forms and constitution
of surface. If the precipitation, whether great or
small in amount, be equally distributed through the seasons,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
so that there are neither torrential rains nor parching droughts,
and if, further, the general inclination of ground be moderate,
so that the superficial waters are carried off without destructive
rapidity of flow, and without sudden accumulation in the
channels of natural drainage, there is little danger of the
degradation of the soil in consequence of the removal of forest
or other vegetable covering, and the natural face of the earth
may be considered as substantially permanent. These conditions
are well exemplified in Ireland, in a great part of England,
in extensive districts in Germany and France, and, fortunately,
in an immense proportion of the valley of the Mississippi
and the basin of the great American lakes, as well as in
many parts of the continents of South America and of Africa.</p>

<p>Destructive changes are most frequent in countries of
irregular and mountainous surface, and in climates where the
precipitation is confined chiefly to a single season, and where
the year is divided into a wet and a dry period, as is the case
throughout a great part of the Ottoman empire, and, more or
less strictly, the whole Mediterranean basin. It is partly,
though by no means entirely, owing to topographical and
climatic causes that the blight, which has smitten the fairest
and most fertile provinces of Imperial Rome, has spared Britannia,
Germania, Pannonia, and M&#339;sia, the comparatively
inhospitable homes of barbarous races, who, in the days of the
C&aelig;sars, were too little advanced in civilized life to possess
either the power or the will to wage that war against the
order of nature which seems, hitherto, an almost inseparable
condition precedent of high social culture, and of great progress
in fine and mechanical art.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>In mountainous countries, on the other hand, various
causes combine to expose the soil to constant dangers. The
rain and snow usually fall in greater quantity, and with much
inequality of distribution; the snow on the summits accumulates
for many months in succession, and then is not unfrequently
almost wholly dissolved in a single thaw, so that the
entire precipitation of months is in a few hours hurried down
the flanks of the mountains, and through the ravines that
furrow them; the natural inclination of the surface promotes
the swiftness of the gathering currents of diluvial rain and of
melting snow, which soon acquire an almost irresistible force,
and power of removal and transportation; the soil itself is
less compact and tenacious than that of the plains, and if the
sheltering forest has been destroyed, it is confined by few of
the threads and ligaments by which nature had bound it
together, and attached it to the rocky groundwork. Hence
every considerable shower lays bare its roods of rock, and the
torrents sent down by the thaws of spring, and by occasional
heavy discharges of the summer and autumnal rains, are seas
of mud and rolling stones that sometimes lay waste, and bury
beneath them acres, and even miles, of pasture and field and
vineyard.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>


<h4><i>Physical Decay of New Countries.</i></h4>

<p>I have remarked that the effects of human action on the
forms of the earth's surface could not always be distinguished
from those resulting from geological causes, and there is also
much uncertainty in respect to the precise influence of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
clearing and cultivating of the ground, and of other rural
operations, upon climate. It is disputed whether either the
mean or the extremes of temperature, the periods of the
seasons, or the amount or distribution of precipitation and of
evaporation, in any country whose annals are known, have
undergone any change during the historical period. It is,
indeed, impossible to doubt that many of the operations of the
pioneer settler tend to produce great modifications in atmospheric
humidity, temperature, and electricity; but we are at
present unable to determine how far one set of effects is neutralized
by another, or compensated by unknown agencies.
This question scientific research is inadequate to solve, for
want of the necessary data; but well conducted observation,
in regions now first brought under the occupation of man,
combined with such historical evidence as still exists, may be
expected at no distant period to throw much light on this
subject.</p>

<p>Australia is, perhaps, the country from which we have a
right to expect the fullest elucidation of these difficult and
disputable problems. Its colonization did not commence until
the physical sciences had become matter of almost universal
attention, and is, indeed, so recent that the memory of living
men embraces the principal epochs of its history; the peculiarities
of its fauna, its flora, and its geology are such as to
have excited for it the liveliest interest of the votaries of
natural science; its mines have given its people the necessary
wealth for procuring the means of instrumental observation,
and the leisure required for the pursuit of scientific research;
and large tracts of virgin forest and natural meadow are rapidly
passing under the control of civilized man. Here, then,
exist greater facilities and stronger motives for the careful study
of the topics in question than have ever been found combined
in any other theatre of European colonization.</p>

<p>In North America, the change from the natural to the artificial
condition of terrestrial surface began about the period
when the most important instruments of meteorological observation
were invented. The first settlers in the territory now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
constituting the United States and the British American provinces
had other things to do than to tabulate barometrical and
thermometrical readings, but there remain some interesting
physical records from the early days of the colonies,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and there
is still an immense extent of North American soil where the
industry and the folly of man have as yet produced little
appreciable change. Here, too, with the present increased
facilities for scientific observation, the future effects, direct and
contingent, of man's labors, can be measured, and such precautions
taken in those rural processes which we call improvements,
as to mitigate evils, perhaps, in some degree, inseparable
from every attempt to control the action of natural
laws.</p>

<p>In order to arrive at safe conclusions, we must first obtain
a more exact knowledge of the topography, and of the present
superficial and climatic condition of countries where the natural
surface is as yet more or less unbroken. This can only be
accomplished by accurate surveys, and by a great multiplication
of the points of meteorological registry,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> already so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
numerous; and as, moreover, considerable changes in the proportion
of forest and of cultivated land, or of dry and wholly
or partially submerged surface, will often take place within
brief periods, it is highly desirable that the attention of
observers, in whose neighborhood the clearing of the soil, or
the drainage of lakes and swamps, or other great works of
rural improvement, are going on or meditated, should be especially
drawn not only to revolutions in atmospheric temperature
and precipitation, but to the more easily ascertained and
perhaps more important local changes produced by these
operations in the temperature and the hygrometric state of
the superficial strata of the earth, and in its spontaneous vegetable
and animal products.</p>

<p>The rapid extension of railroads, which now everywhere
keeps pace with, and sometimes even precedes, the occupation
of new soil for agricultural purposes, furnishes great facilities
for enlarging our knowledge of the topography of the territory
they traverse, because their cuttings reveal the composition
and general structure of surface, and the inclination and elevation
of their lines constitute known hypsometrical sections,
which give numerous points of departure for the measurement
of higher and lower stations, and of course for determining
the relief and depression of surface, the slope of the
beds of watercourses, and many other not less important
questions.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>The geological, hydrographical, and topographical surveys,
which almost every general and even local government of the
civilized world is carrying on, are making yet more important
contributions to our stock of geographical and general physical
knowledge, and, within a comparatively short space, there will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
be an accumulation of well established constant and historical
facts, from which we can safely reason upon all the relations
of action and reaction between man and external nature.</p>

<p>But we are, even now, breaking up the floor and wainscoting
and doors and window frames of our dwelling, for
fuel to warm our bodies and seethe our pottage, and the world
cannot afford to wait till the slow and sure progress of exact
science has taught it a better economy. Many practical
lessons have been learned by the common observation of
unschooled men; and the teachings of simple experience, on
topics where natural philosophy has scarcely yet spoken, are
not to be despised.</p>

<p>In these humble pages, which do not in the least aspire to
rank among scientific expositions of the laws of nature, I shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
attempt to give the most important practical conclusions suggested
by the history of man's efforts to replenish the earth
and subdue it; and I shall aim to support those conclusions by
such facts and illustrations only as address themselves to the
understanding of every intelligent reader, and as are to be
found recorded in works capable of profitable perusal, or at
least consultation, by persons who have not enjoyed a special
scientific training.</p>

<h4><i>Modern Geography embraces Organic Life.</i></h4>

<p>It was a narrow view of geography which confined that
science to delineation of terrestrial surface and outline, and to
description of the relative position and magnitude of land and
water. In its improved form, it embraces not only the globe
itself, but the living things which vegetate or move upon it,
the varied influences they exert upon each other, the reciprocal
action and reaction between them and the earth they
inhabit. Even if the end of geographical studies were only to
obtain a knowledge of the external forms of the mineral and
fluid masses which constitute the globe, it would still be
necessary to take into account the element of life; for every
plant, every animal, is a geographical agency, man a destruc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>tive,
vegetables, and even wild beasts, restorative powers.
The rushing waters sweep down earth from the uplands; in
the first moment of repose, vegetation seeks to re&euml;stablish
itself on the bared surface, and, by the slow deposit of its
decaying products, to raise again the soil which the torrent
had lowered. So important an element of reconstruction is
this, that it has been seriously questioned whether, upon the
whole, vegetation does not contribute as much to elevate, as
the waters to depress, the level of the surface.</p>

<p>Whenever man has transported a plant from its native
habitat to a new soil, he has introduced a new geographical
force to act upon it, and this generally at the expense of some
indigenous growth which the foreign vegetable has supplanted.
The new and the old plants are rarely the equivalents of each
other, and the substitution of an exotic for a native tree, shrub,
or grass, increases or diminishes the relative importance of the
vegetable element in the geography of the country to which
it is removed. Further, man sows that he may reap. The
products of agricultural industry are not suffered to rot upon
the ground, and thus raise it by an annual stratum of new
mould. They are gathered, transported to greater or less distances,
and after they have served their uses in human economy,
they enter, on the final decomposition of their elements,
into new combinations, and are only in small proportion
returned to the soil on which they grew. The roots of the
grasses, and of many other cultivated plants, however, usually
remain and decay in the earth, and contribute to raise its
surface, though certainly not in the same degree as the forest.</p>

<p>The vegetables, which have taken the place of trees,
unquestionably perform many of the same functions. They
radiate heat, they condense the humidity of the atmosphere,
they act upon the chemical constitution of the air, their roots
penetrate the earth to greater depths than is commonly supposed,
and form an inextricable labyrinth of filaments which
bind the soil together and prevent its erosion by water. The
broad-leaved annuals and perennials, too, shade the ground,
and prevent the evaporation of moisture from its surface by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
wind and sun.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> At a certain stage of growth, grass land is
probably a more energetic radiator and condenser than even
the forest, but this powerful action is exerted, in its full intensity,
for a few days only, while trees continue such functions,
with unabated vigor, for many months in succession. Upon
the whole, it seems quite certain, that no cultivated ground is
as efficient in tempering climatic extremes, or in conservation
of geographical surface and outline, as is the soil which nature
herself has planted.</p>


<h4><i>Transfer of Vegetable Life.</i></h4>

<p>It belongs to vegetable and animal geography, which are
almost sciences of themselves, to point out in detail what man
has done to change the distribution of plants and of animated
life and to revolutionize the aspect of organic nature; but
some of the more important facts bearing on this subject may
pertinently be introduced here. Most of the fruit trees grown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
in Europe and the United States are believed, and&mdash;if the
testimony of Pliny and other ancient naturalists is to be
depended upon&mdash;many of them are historically known, to have
originated in the temperate climates of Asia. The wine grape
has been thought to be truly indigenous only in the regions
bordering on the eastern end of the Black Sea, where it now,
particularly on the banks of the Rion, the ancient Phasis,
propagates itself spontaneously, and grows with unexampled
luxuriance.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> But, some species of the vine seem native to
Europe, and many varieties of grape have been too long
known as common to every part of the United States to admit
of the supposition that they were all introduced by European
colonists.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>It is an interesting fact that the commerce&mdash;or at least the
maritime carrying trade&mdash;and the agricultural and mechanical
industry of the world are, in very large proportion, dependent
on vegetable and animal products little or not at all known
to ancient Greek, Roman, and Jewish civilization. In many
instances, the chief supply of these articles comes from countries
to which they are probably indigenous, and where they
are still almost exclusively grown; but in many others, the
plants or animals from which they are derived have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
introduced by man into the regions now remarkable for their
most successful cultivation, and that, too, in comparatively
recent times, or, in other words, within two or three centuries.</p>


<h4><i>Foreign Plants grown in the United States.</i></h4>

<p>According to Bigelow, the United States had, on the first
of June, 1860, in round numbers, 163,000,000 acres of improved
land, the quantity having been increased by 50,000,000
acres within the ten years next preceding.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Not to mention
less important crops, this land produced, in the year ending
on the day last mentioned, in round numbers, 171,000,000
bushels of wheat, 21,000,000 bushels of rye, 172,000,000 bushels
of oats, 15,000,000 bushels of pease and beans, 16,000,000
bushels of barley, orchard fruits to the value of $20,000,000,
900,000 bushels of cloverseed, 900,000 bushels of other grass
seed, 104,000 tons of hemp, 4,000,000 pounds of flax, and
600,000 pounds of flaxseed. These vegetable growths were
familiar to ancient European agriculture, but they were all
introduced into North America after the close of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>Of the fruits of agricultural industry unknown to the
Greeks and Romans, or too little employed by them to be
of any commercial importance, the United States produced,
in the same year, 187,000,000 pounds of rice, 18,000,000 bushels
of buckwheat, 2,075,000,000 pounds of ginned cotton,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
302,000,000 pounds of cane sugar, 16,000,000 gallons of cane
molasses, 7,000,000 gallons of sorghum molasses, all yielded
by vegetables introduced into that country within two hundred
years, and&mdash;with the exception of buckwheat, the origin of
which is uncertain, and of cotton&mdash;all, directly or indirectly,
from the East Indies; besides, from indigenous plants unknown
to ancient agriculture, 830,000,000 bushels of Indian corn or
maize, 429,000,000 pounds of tobacco, 110,000,000 bushels of
potatoes, 42,000,000 bushels of sweet potatoes, 39,000,000
pounds of maple sugar, and 2,000,000 gallons of maple molasses.
To all this we are to add 19,000,000 tons of hay,
produced partly by new, partly by long known, partly by
exotic, partly by native herbs and grasses, an incalculable
quantity of garden vegetables, chiefly of European or Asiatic
origin, and many minor agricultural products.</p>

<p>The weight of this harvest of a year would be not less than
60,000,000 tons&mdash;which is eleven times the tonnage of all the
shipping of the United States at the close of the year 1861&mdash;and,
with the exception of the maple sugar, the maple molasses,
and the products of the Western prairie lands and some
small Indian clearings, it was all grown upon lands wrested
from the forest by the European race within little more than
two hundred years. The wants of Europe have introduced
into the colonies of tropical America the sugar cane, the coffee
plant, the orange and the lemon,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> all of Oriental origin, have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
immensely stimulated the cultivation of the former two in the
countries of which they are natives, and, of course, promoted
agricultural operations which must have affected the geography
of those regions to an extent proportionate to the scale on
which they have been pursued.</p>


<h4><i>American Plants grown in Europe.</i></h4>

<p>America has partially repaid her debt to the Eastern continent.
Maize and the potato are very valuable additions to
the field agriculture of Europe and the East, and the tomato is
no mean gift to the kitchen gardens of the Old World, though
certainly not an adequate return for the multitude of esculent
roots and leguminous plants which the European colonists
carried with them.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> I wish I could believe, with some, that
America is not alone responsible for the introduction of the
filthy weed, tobacco, the use of which is the most vulgar and
pernicious habit engrafted by the semi-barbarism of modern
civilization upon the less multifarious sensualism of ancient
life;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> but the alleged occurrence of pipe-like objects in Scla<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>vonic,
and, it has been said, in Hungarian sepulchres, is hardly
sufficient evidence to convict those races of complicity in this
grave offence against the temperance and the refinement of
modern society.</p>


<h4><i>Modes of Introduction of Foreign Plants.</i></h4>

<p>Besides the vegetables I have mentioned, we know that
many plants of smaller economical value have been the subjects
of international exchange in very recent times. Busbequius,
Austrian ambassador at Constantinople about the
middle of the sixteenth century&mdash;whose letters contain one of
the best accounts of Turkish life which have appeared down
to the present day&mdash;brought home from the Ottoman capital
the lilac and the tulip. The Belgian Clusius about the same
time introduced from the East the horse chestnut, which has
since wandered to America. The weeping willows of Europe
and the United States are said to have sprung from a slip
received from Smyrna by the poet Pope, and planted by him
in an English garden; and the Portuguese declare that the
progenitor of all the European and American oranges was an
Oriental tree transplanted to Lisbon, and still living in the last
generation.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The present favorite flowers of the parterres of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Europe have been imported from America, Japan and other
remote Oriental countries, within a century and a half, and, in
fine, there are few vegetables of any agricultural importance,
few ornamental trees or decorative plants, which are not now
common to the three civilized continents.</p>

<p><a name="Page_65_2" id="Page_65_2"></a>The statistics of vegetable emigration exhibit numerical
results quite surprising to those not familiar with the subject.
The lonely island of St. Helena is described as producing, at
the time of its discovery in the year 1501, about sixty vegetable
species, including some three or four known to grow
elsewhere also. At the present time its flora numbers seven
hundred and fifty species. Humboldt and Bonpland found,
among the unquestionably indigenous plants of tropical
America, monocotyledons only, all the dicotyledons of those
extensive regions having been probably introduced after the
colonization of the New World by Spain.</p>

<p>The faculty of spontaneous reproduction and perpetuation
necessarily supposes a greater power of accommodation, within
a certain range, than we find in most domesticated plants, for
it would rarely happen that the seed of a wild plant would fall
into ground as nearly similar, in composition and condition, to
that where its parent grew, as the soils of different fields artificially
prepared for growing a particular vegetable are to each
other. Accordingly, though every wild species affects a habitat
of a particular character, it is found that, if accidentally
or designedly sown elsewhere, it will grow under conditions
extremely unlike those of its birthplace.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Cooper says: "We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
cannot say positively that <i>any</i> plant is <i>uncultivable</i> anywhere
until it has been tried;" and this seems to be even more true
of wild than of domesticated vegetation.</p>

<p>The seven hundred new species which have found their
way to St. Helena within three centuries and a half, were certainly
not all, or even in the largest proportion, designedly
planted there by human art, and if we were well acquainted
with vegetable emigration, we should probably be able to
show that man has intentionally transferred fewer plants than
he has accidentally introduced into countries foreign to them.
After the wheat, follow the tares that infest it. The weeds
that grow among the cereal grains, the pests of the kitchen
garden, are the same in America as in Europe.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The overturning
of a wagon, or any of the thousand accidents which
befall the emigrant in his journey across the Western plains,
may scatter upon the ground the seeds he designed for his
garden, and the herbs which fill so important a place in the
rustic materia medica of the Eastern States, spring up along
the prairie paths but just opened by the caravan of the settler.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
The hortus siccus of a botanist may accidentally sow seeds
from the foot of the Himalayas on the plains that skirt the
Alps; and it is a fact of very familiar observation, that exotics,
transplanted to foreign climates suited to their growth, often
escape from the flower garden and naturalize themselves
among the spontaneous vegetation of the pastures. When
the cases containing the artistic treasures of Thorvaldsen were
opened in the court of the museum where they are deposited,
the straw and grass employed in packing them were scattered
upon the ground, and the next season there sprang up from
the seeds no less than twenty-five species of plants belonging
to the Roman campagna, some of which were preserved and
cultivated as a new tribute to the memory of the great Scandinavian
sculptor, and at least four are said to have spontaneously
naturalized themselves about Copenhagen.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In the
campaign of 1814, the Russian troops brought, in the stuffing
of their saddles and by other accidental means, seeds from the
banks of the Dnieper to the valley of the Rhine, and even
introduced the plants of the steppes into the environs of Paris.
The Turkish armies, in their incursions into Europe, brought
Eastern vegetables in their train, and left the seeds of Oriental
wall plants to grow upon the ramparts of Buda and Vienna.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
The Canada thistle, <i>Erigeron Canadense</i>, is said to have
sprung up in Europe, two hundred years ago, from a seed
which dropped out of the stuffed skin of a bird.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>


<h4><i>Vegetables, how affected by Transfer to Foreign Soils.</i></h4>

<p>Vegetables, naturalized abroad either by accident or design,
sometimes exhibit a greatly increased luxuriance of growth.
The European cardoon, an esculent thistle, has broken out
from the gardens of the Spanish colonies on the La Plata,
acquired a gigantic stature, and propagated itself, in impenetrable
thickets, over hundreds of leagues of the Pampas; and
the <i>Anacharis alsinastrum</i>, a water plant not much inclined
to spread in its native American habitat, has found its way
into English rivers, and extended itself to such a degree as to
form a serious obstruction to the flow of the current, and even
to navigation.</p>

<p>Not only do many wild plants exhibit a remarkable facility
of accommodation, but their seeds usually possess great tenacity
of life, and their germinating power resists very severe
trials. Hence, while the seeds of very many cultivated vegetables
lose their vitality in two or three years, and can be
transported safely to distant countries only with great precautions,
the weeds that infest those vegetables, though not cared
for by man, continue to accompany him in his migrations, and
find a new home on every soil he colonizes. Nature fights in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
defence of her free children, but wars upon them when they
have deserted her banners and tamely submitted to the
dominion of man.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Not only is the wild plant much hardier than the domesticated
vegetable, but the same law prevails in animated brute
and even human life. The beasts of the chase are more capable
of endurance and privation and more tenacious of life, than
the domesticated animals which most nearly resemble them.
The savage fights on, after he has received half a dozen mortal
wounds, the least of which would have instantly paralyzed the
strength of his civilized enemy, and, like the wild boar,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> he
has been known to press forward along the shaft of the spear
which was transpiercing his vitals, and to deal a deathblow on
the soldier who wielded it.</p>

<p>True, domesticated plants can be gradually acclimatized to
bear a degree of heat or of cold, which, in their wild state,
they would not have supported; the trained English racer
outstrips the swiftest horse of the pampas or prairies, perhaps
even the less systematically educated courser of the Arab; the
strength of the European, as tested by the dynamometer, is
greater than that of the New Zealander. But all these are
instances of excessive development of particular capacities and
faculties at the expense of general vital power. Expose
untamed and domesticated forms of life, together, to an entire
set of physical conditions equally alien to the former habits of
both, so that every power of resistance and accommodation
shall be called into action, and the wild plant or animal will
live, while the domesticated will perish.</p>

<p>The saline atmosphere of the sea is specially injurious both
to seeds and to very many young plants, and it is only recently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
that the transportation of some very important vegetables
across the ocean has been made practicable, through the
invention of Ward's airtight glass cases. It is by this means
that large numbers of the trees which produce the Jesuit's
bark have been successfully transplanted from America to the
British possessions in the East, where it is hoped they will become
fully naturalized.</p>


<h4><i>Extirpation of Vegetables.</i></h4>

<p>Lamentable as are the evils produced by the too general
felling of the woods in the Old World, I believe it does not
satisfactorily appear that any species of native forest tree has
yet been extirpated by man on the Eastern continent. The
roots, stumps, trunks, and foliage found in bogs are recognized
as belonging to still extant species. Except in some few cases
where there is historical evidence that foreign material was
employed, the timber of the oldest European buildings, and
even of the lacustrine habitations of Switzerland, is evidently
the product of trees still common in or near the countries
where such architectural remains are found; nor have the
Egyptian catacombs themselves revealed to us the former
existence of any woods not now familiar to us as the growth of
still living trees.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> It is, however, said that the yew tree,
<i>Taxus baccata</i>, formerly very common in England, Germany,
and&mdash;as we are authorized to infer from Theophrastus&mdash;in
Greece, has almost wholly disappeared from the latter country,
and seems to be dying out in Germany. The wood of the
yew surpasses that of any other European tree in closeness
and fineness of grain, and it is well known for the elasticity
which of old made it so great a favorite with the English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
archer. It is much in request among wood carvers and turners,
and the demand for it explains, in part, its increasing
scarcity. It is also worth remarking that no insect depends
upon it for food or shelter, or aids in its fructification, no bird
feeds upon its berries&mdash;the latter a circumstance of some
importance, because the tree hence wants one means of propagation
or diffusion common to so many other plants. But it
is alleged that the reproductive power of the yew is exhausted,
and that it can no longer be readily propagated by the natural
sowing of its seeds, or by artificial methods. If further investigation
and careful experiment should establish this fact, it
will go far to show that a climatic change, of a character unfavorable
to the growth of the yew, has really taken place in
Germany, though not yet proved by instrumental observation,
and the most probable cause of such change would be found
in the diminution of the area covered by the forests.</p>

<p>The industry of man is said to have been so successful in the
local extirpation of noxious or useless vegetables in China, that,
with the exception of a few water plants in the rice grounds, it
is sometimes impossible to find a single weed in an extensive
district; and the late eminent agriculturist, Mr. Coke, is reported
to have offered in vain a considerable reward for the detection
of a weed in a large wheatfield on his estate in England. In
these cases, however, there is no reason to suppose that diligent
husbandry has done more than to eradicate the pests of
agriculture within a comparatively limited area, and the cockle
and the darnel will probably remain to plague the slovenly
cultivator as long as the cereal grains continue to bless him.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>


<h4><i>Origin of Domestic Plants.</i></h4>

<p>One of the most important, and, at the same time, most
difficult questions connected with our subject is: how far we
are to regard our cereal grains, our esculent bulbs and roots,
and the multiplied tree fruits of our gardens, as artificially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
modified and improved forms of wild, self-propagating vegetation.
The narratives of botanical travellers have often
announced the discovery of the original form and habitat of
domesticated plants, and scientific journals have described the
experiments by which the identity of particular wild and cultivated
vegetables has been thought to be established. It is
confidently affirmed that maize and the potato&mdash;which we
must suppose to have been first cultivated at a much later
period than the breadstuffs and most other esculent vegetables
of Europe and the East&mdash;are found wild and self-propagating
in Spanish America, though in forms not recognizable by the
common observer as identical with the familiar corn and tuber
of modern agriculture. It was lately asserted, upon what
seemed very strong evidence, that the <i>&AElig;gilops ovata</i>, a plant
growing wild in Southern France, had been actually converted
into common wheat; but, upon a repetition of the experiments,
later observers have declared that the apparent change
was only a case of temporary hybridation or fecundation by
the pollen of true wheat, and that the grass alleged to be transformed
into wheat could not be perpetuated as such from its
own seed.</p>

<p><a name="Page_73_2" id="Page_73_2"></a>The very great modifications which cultivated plants are
constantly undergoing under our eyes, and the numerous
varieties and races which spring up among them, certainly
countenance the doctrine, that every domesticated vegetable,
however dependent upon human care for growth and propagation
in its present form, may have been really derived, by a
long succession of changes, from some wild plant not now
much resembling it. But it is, in every case, a question of
evidence. The only satisfactory proof that a given wild plant
is identical with a given garden or field vegetable, is the test
of experiment, the actual growing of the one from the seed of
the other, or the conversion of the one into the other by transplantation
and change of conditions. It is hardly contended
that any of the cereals or other plants important as human
aliment, or as objects of agricultural industry, exist and propagate
themselves uncultivated in the same form and with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
same properties as when sown and reared by human art.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> In
fact, the cases are rare where the identity of a wild with a
domesticated plant is considered by the best authorities as conclusively
established, and we are warranted in affirming of but
few of the latter, as a historically known or experimentally
proved fact, that they ever did exist, or could exist, independently
of man.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Organic Life as a Geological and Geographical Agency.</i></h4>

<p>The quantitative value of organic life, as a geological
agency, seems to be inversely as the volume of the individual
organism; for nature supplies by numbers what is wanting in
the bulk of the plant or animal out of whose remains or structures
she forms strata covering whole provinces, and builds
up from the depths of the sea large islands, if not continents.
There are, it is true, near the mouths of the great Siberian
rivers which empty themselves into the Polar Sea, drift islands
composed, in an incredibly large proportion, of the bones and
tusks of elephants, mastodons, and other huge pachyderms,
and many extensive caves in various parts of the world are
half filled with the skeletons of quadrupeds, sometimes lying
loose in the earth, sometimes cemented together into an osseous
breccia by a calcareous deposit or other binding material.
These remains of large animals, though found in comparatively
late formations, generally belong to extinct species, and their
modern congeners or representatives do not exist in sufficient
numbers to be of sensible importance in geology or in geography
by the mere mass of their skeletons.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> But the vegetable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
products found with them, and, in rare cases, in the stomachs
of some of them, are those of yet extant plants; and besides
this evidence, the recent discovery of works of human art,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
deposited in juxtaposition with fossil bones, and evidently at
the same time and by the same agency which buried these
latter&mdash;not to speak of alleged human bones found in the same
strata&mdash;proves that the animals whose former existence they
testify were contemporaneous with man, and possibly even
extirpated by him.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> I do not propose to enter upon the
thorny question, whether the existing races of man are genealogically
connected with these ancient types of humanity, and
I advert to these facts only for the sake of the suggestion that
man, in his earliest known stages of existence, was probably
a destructive power upon the earth, though perhaps not so
emphatically as his present representatives.</p>

<p>The larger wild animals are not now numerous enough in
any one region to form extensive deposits by their remains;
but they have, nevertheless, a certain geographical importance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
If the myriads of large browsing and grazing quadrupeds
which wander over the plains of Southern Africa&mdash;and the
slaughter of which by thousands is the source of a ferocious
pleasure and a brutal triumph to professedly civilized hunters&mdash;if
the herds of the American bison, which are numbered by
hundreds of thousands, do not produce visible changes in the
forms of terrestrial surface, they have at least an immense
influence on the growth and distribution of vegetable life, and,
of course, indirectly upon all the physical conditions of soil
and climate between which and vegetation a mutual interdependence
exists.</p>

<p>The influence of wild quadrupeds upon vegetable life has
been little studied, and not many facts bearing upon it have
been recorded, but, so far as it is known, it appears to be conservative
rather than pernicious.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Few if any of them depend
for their subsistence on vegetable products obtainable only by
the destruction of the plant, and they seem to confine their
consumption almost exclusively to the annual harvest of leaf
or twig, or at least of parts of the vegetable easily reproduced.
If there are exceptions to this rule, they are in cases where the
numbers of the animal are so proportioned to the abundance
of the vegetable, that there is no danger of the extermination
of the plant from the voracity of the quadruped, or of the
extinction of the quadruped from the scarcity of the plant.
In diet and natural wants the bison resembles the ox, the ibex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
and the chamois assimilate themselves to the goat and the
sheep; but while the wild animal does not appear to be a
destructive agency in the garden of nature, his domestic congeners
are eminently so. This is partly from the change of
habits resulting from domestication and association with man,
partly from the fact that the number of reclaimed animals is
not determined by the natural relation of demand and spontaneous
supply which regulates the multiplication of wild
creatures, but by the convenience of man, who is, in comparatively
few things, amenable to the control of the merely physical
arrangements of nature. When the domesticated animal
escapes from human jurisdiction, as in the case of the ox, the
horse, the goat, and perhaps the ass&mdash;which, so far as I know,
are the only well-authenticated instances of the complete
emancipation of household quadrupeds&mdash;he becomes again an
unresisting subject of nature, and all his economy is governed
by the same laws as that of his fellows which have never been
enslaved by man; but, so long as he obeys a human lord, he
is an auxiliary in the warfare his master is ever waging against
all existences except those which he can tame to a willing
servitude.</p>


<h4><i>Number of Quadrupeds in the United States.</i></h4>

<p>Civilization is so intimately associated with, if not dependent
upon, certain inferior forms of animal life, that cultivated
man has never failed to accompany himself, in all his migrations,
with some of these humble attendants. The ox, the horse,
the sheep, and even the comparatively useless dog and cat, as
well as several species of poultry, are voluntarily transported
by every emigrant colony, and they soon multiply to numbers
very far exceeding those of the wild genera most nearly corresponding
to them.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> According to the census of the United<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
States for 1860,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> the total number of horses in all the States
of the American Union, was, in round numbers, 7,300,000;
of asses and mules, 1,300,000; of the ox tribe, 29,000,000;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> of
sheep, 25,000,000; and of swine, 39,000,000. The only North<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
American quadruped sufficiently gregarious in habits, and sufficiently
multiplied in numbers, to form really large herds, is the
bison, or, as he is commonly called in America, the buffalo; and
this animal is confined to the prairie region of the Mississippi
basin and Northern Mexico. The engineers sent out to survey
railroad routes to the Pacific estimated the number of a single
herd of bisons seen within the last ten years on the great plains
near the Upper Missouri, at not less than 200,000, and yet the
range occupied by this animal is now very much smaller in
area than it was when the whites first established themselves
on the prairies.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> But it must be remarked that the American
buffalo is a migratory animal, and that, at the season of his
annual journeys, the whole stock of a vast extent of pasture
ground is collected into a single army, which is seen at or
very near any one point only for a few days during the entire
season. Hence there is risk of great error in estimating the
numbers of the bison in a given district from the magnitude
of the herds seen at or about the same time at a single place
of observation; and, upon the whole, it is neither proved nor
probable that the bison was ever, at any one time, as numerous
in North America as the domestic bovine species is at present.
The elk, the moose, the musk ox, the caribou, and the smaller
quadrupeds popularly embraced under the general name of
deer,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> though sufficient for the wants of a sparse savage popu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>lation,
were never numerically very abundant, and the carnivora
which fed upon them were still less so. It is almost
needless to add that the Rocky Mountain sheep and goat must
always have been very rare.</p>

<p>Summing up the whole, then, it is evident that the wild
quadrupeds of North America, even when most numerous,
were few compared with their domestic successors, that they
required a much less supply of vegetable food, and consequently
were far less important as geographical elements than
the many millions of hoofed and horned cattle now fed by
civilized man on the same continent.</p>


<h4><i>Origin and Transfer of Domestic Quadrupeds.</i></h4>

<p>Of the origin of our domestic animals, we know historically
nothing, because their domestication belongs to the ages
which preceded written history; but though they cannot all
be specifically identified with now extant wild animals, it is
presumable that they have been reclaimed from an originally
wild state. Ancient annalists have preserved to us fewer data
respecting the introduction of domestic animals into new countries
than respecting the transplantation of domestic vegetables.
Ritter, in his learned essay on the camel, has shown that this
animal was not employed by the Egyptians until a comparatively
late period in their history; that he was unknown to
the Carthaginians until after the downfall of their commonwealth;
and that his first appearance in Western Africa is
more recent still. The Bactrian camel was certainly brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
from Asia Minor to the Northern shores of the Black Sea, by
the Goths, in the third or fourth century.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The Arabian
single-humped camel, or dromedary, has been carried to the
Canary Islands, partially introduced into Australia, Greece,
Spain, and even Tuscany, experimented upon to little purpose
in Venezuela, and finally imported by the American Government
into Texas and New Mexico, where it finds the climate
and the vegetable products best suited to its wants, and promises
to become a very useful agent in the promotion of the
special civilization for which those regions are adapted.
America had no domestic quadruped but a species of dog, the
lama tribe, and, to a certain extent, the bison or buffalo.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Of
course, it owes the horse, the ass, the ox, the sheep, the goat,
and the swine, as does also Australia, to European colonization.
Modern Europe has, thus far, not accomplished much
in the way of importation of new animals, though some interesting
essays have been made. The reindeer was successfully
introduced into Iceland about a century ago, while similar
attempts failed, about the same time, in Scotland. The Cashmere
or Thibet goat was brought to France a generation since,
and succeeds well. The same or an allied species and the
Asiatic buffalo were carried to South Carolina about the year
1850, and the former, at least, is thought likely to prove of
permanent value in the United States. The yak, or Tartary ox,
seems to thrive in France, and success has attended the recent
efforts to introduce the South American alpaca into Europe.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Extirpation of Quadrupeds.</i></h4>

<p>Although man never fails greatly to diminish, and is perhaps
destined ultimately to exterminate, such of the larger wild
quadrupeds as he cannot profitably domesticate, yet their numbers
often fluctuate, and even after they seem almost extinct,
they sometimes suddenly increase, without any intentional
steps to promote such a result on his part. During the wars
which followed the French Revolution, the wolf multiplied in
many parts of Europe, partly because the hunters were withdrawn
from the woods to chase a nobler game, and partly
because the bodies of slain men and horses supplied this voracious
quadruped with more abundant food. The same animal
became again more numerous in Poland after the general disarming
of the rural population by the Russian Government.
On the other hand, when the hunters pursue the wolf, the
graminivorous wild quadrupeds increase, and thus in turn promote
the multiplication of their great four-footed destroyer by
augmenting the supply of his nourishment. So long as the
fur of the beaver was extensively employed as a material for
fine hats, it bore a very high price, and the chase of this quadruped
was so keen that naturalists feared its speedy extinction.
When a Parisian manufacturer invented the silk hat, which
soon came into almost universal use, the demand for beavers'
fur fell off, and this animal&mdash;whose habits, as we have seen, are
an important agency in the formation of bogs and other modifications
of forest nature&mdash;immediately began to increase, reappeared
in haunts which he had long abandoned, and can no
longer be regarded as rare enough to be in immediate danger
of extirpation. Thus the convenience or the caprice of Parisian
fashion has unconsciously exercised an influence which may
sensibly affect the physical geography of a distant continent.</p>

<p>Since the invention of gunpowder, some quadrupeds have
completely disappeared from many European and Asiatic
countries where they were formerly numerous. The last wolf
was killed in Great Britain two hundred years ago, and the
bear was extirpated from that island still earlier. The British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
wild ox exists only in a few English and Scottish parks, while
in Irish bogs, of no great apparent antiquity, are found antlers
which testify to the former existence of a stag much larger
than any extant European species. The lion is believed to
have inhabited Asia Minor and Syria, and probably Greece
and Sicily also, long after the commencement of the historical
period, and he is even said to have been not yet extinct in the
first-named two of these countries at the time of the first Crusades.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
Two large graminivorous or browsing quadrupeds,
the ur and the schelk, once common in Germany, are utterly
extinct, the eland and the auerochs nearly so. The Nibelungen-Lied,
which, in the oldest form preserved to us, dates from
about the year 1,200, though its original composition no doubt
belongs to an earlier period, thus sings:</p>

<p class="poem">
Then slowe the dowghtie Sigfrid a wisent and an elk,<br />
He smote four stoute uroxen and a grim and sturdie schelk.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
</p>

<p>Modern naturalists identify the elk with the eland, the wisent
with the auerochs. The period when the ur and the schelk
became extinct is not known. The auerochs survived in
Prussia until the middle of the last century, but unless it is
identical with a similar quadruped said to be found on the
Caucasus, it now exists only in the Russian imperial forest of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Bialowitz, where about a thousand are still preserved, and in
some great menageries, as for example that at Sch&ouml;nbrunn,
near Vienna, which, in 1852, had four specimens. The eland,
which is closely allied to the American wapiti, if not specifically
the same animal, is still kept in the royal preserves of
Prussia, to the number of four or five hundred individuals.
The chamois is becoming rare, and the ibex or steinbock, once
common in all the high Alps, is now believed to be confined
to the Cogne mountains in Piedmont, between the valleys of
the Dora Baltea and the Orco.</p>


<h4><i>Number of Birds in the United States.</i></h4>

<p>The tame fowls play a much less conspicuous part in rural
life than the quadrupeds, and, in their relations to the economy
of nature, they are of very much less moment than four-footed
animals, or than the undomesticated birds. The domestic
turkey<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> is probably more numerous in the territory of the
United States than the wild bird of the same species ever was,
and the grouse cannot, at the period of their greatest abundance,
have counted as many as we now number of the common
hen. The dove, however, must fall greatly short of the
wild pigeon in multitude, and it is hardly probable that the
flocks of domestic geese and ducks are as numerous as once
were those of their wild congeners. The pigeon, indeed,
seems to have multiplied immensely, for some years after the
first clearings in the woods, because the settlers warred unsparingly
upon the hawk, while the crops of grain and other vegetable
growths increased the supply of food within the reach of
the young birds, at the age when their power of flight is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
yet great enough to enable them to seek it over a wide area.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
The pigeon is not described by the earliest white inhabitants
of the American States as filling the air with such clouds of
winged life as astonish naturalists in the descriptions of Audubon,
and, at the present day, the net and the gun have so
reduced its abundance, that its appearance in large numbers is
recorded only at long intervals, and it is never seen in the
great flocks remembered by many still living observers as
formerly very common.</p>


<h4><i>Birds as Sowers and Consumers of Seeds, and as
Destroyers of Insects.</i></h4>

<p>Wild birds form of themselves a very conspicuous and
interesting feature in the <i>staffage</i>, as painters call it, of the
natural landscape, and they are important elements in the
view we are taking of geography, whether we consider their
immediate or their incidental influence. Birds affect vegetation
directly by sowing seeds and by consuming them; they
affect it indirectly by destroying insects injurious, or, in some
cases, beneficial to vegetable life. Hence, when we kill a seed-sowing
bird, we check the dissemination of a plant; when we
kill a bird which digests the seed it swallows, we promote the
increase of a vegetable. Nature protects the seeds of wild,
much more effectually than those of domesticated plants. The
cereal grains are completely digested when consumed by birds,
but the germ of the smaller stone fruits and of very many other
wild vegetables is uninjured, perhaps even stimulated to more
vigorous growth, by the natural chemistry of the bird's stomach.
The power of flight and the restless habits of the bird
enable it to transport heavy seeds to far greater distances than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
they could be carried by the wind. A swift-winged bird may
drop cherry stones a thousand miles from the tree they grow
on; a hawk, in tearing a pigeon, may scatter from its crop the
still fresh rice it had swallowed at a distance of ten degrees of
latitude,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and thus the occurrence of isolated plants in situations
where their presence cannot otherwise well be explained, is
easily accounted for. There is a large class of seeds apparently
specially fitted by nature for dissemination by animals. I
refer to those which attach themselves, by means of hooks, or
by viscous juices, to the coats of quadrupeds and the feathers
of birds, and are thus transported wherever their living vehicles
may chance to wander. Some birds, too, deliberately
bury seeds, not indeed with a foresight aiming directly at the
propagation of the plant, but from apparently purposeless
secretiveness, or as a mode of preserving food for future use.</p>

<p>An unfortunate popular error greatly magnifies the injury
done to the crops of grain and leguminous vegetables by wild
birds. Very many of those generally supposed to consume
large quantities of the seeds of cultivated plants really feed
almost exclusively upon insects, and frequent the wheatfields,
not for the sake of the grain, but for the eggs, larv&aelig;, and fly
of the multiplied tribes of insect life which are so destructive
to the harvests. This fact has been so well established by the
examination of the stomachs of great numbers of birds in
Europe and New England, at different seasons of the year,
that it is no longer open to doubt, and it appears highly probable
that even the species which consume more or less grain
generally make amends, by destroying insects whose ravages
would have been still more injurious.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> On this subject, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
have much other evidence besides that derived from dissection.
Direct observation has shown, in many instances, that the
destruction of wild birds has been followed by a great multiplication
of noxious insects, and, on the other hand, that these
latter have been much reduced in numbers by the protection
and increase of the birds that devour them. Many interesting
facts of this nature have been collected by professed naturalists,
but I shall content myself with a few taken from familiar
and generally accessible sources. The following extract is
from Michelet, <i>L'Oiseau</i> pp. 169, 170:</p>

<p>"The <i>stingy</i> farmer&mdash;an epithet justly and feelingly bestowed
by Virgil. Avaricious, blind, indeed, who proscribes
the birds&mdash;those destroyers of insects, those defenders of his
harvests. Not a grain for the creature which, during the rains
of winter, hunts the future insect, finds out the nests of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
larv&aelig;, examines, turns over every leaf, and destroys, every
day, thousands of incipient caterpillars. But sacks of corn for
the mature insect, whole fields for the grasshoppers, which the
bird would have made war upon. With eyes fixed upon his
furrow, upon the present moment only, without seeing and
without foreseeing, blind to the great harmony which is never
broken with impunity, he has everywhere demanded or approved
laws for the extermination of that necessary ally of his
toil&mdash;the insectivorous bird. And the insect has well avenged
the bird. It has become necessary to revoke in haste the proscription.
In the Isle of Bourbon, for instance, a price was set
on the head of the martin; it disappeared, and the grasshoppers
took possession of the island, devouring, withering, scorching
with a biting drought all that they did not consume. In
North America it has been the same with the starling, the
protector of Indian corn.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Even the sparrow, which really
does attack grain, but which protects it still more, the pilferer,
the outlaw, loaded with abuse and smitten with curses&mdash;it has
been found in Hungary that they were likely to perish without
him, that he alone could sustain the mighty war against the
beetles and the thousand winged enemies that swarm in the
lowlands; they have revoked the decree of banishment, recalled
in haste this valiant militia, which, though deficient in
discipline, is nevertheless the salvation of the country.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not long since, in the neighborhood of Rouen and in the
valley of Monville, the blackbird was for some time proscribed.
The beetles profited well by this proscription; their larv&aelig;,
infinitely multiplied, carried on their subterranean labors with
such success, that a meadow was shown me, the surface of
which was completely dried up, every herbaceous root was
consumed, and the whole grassy mantle, easily loosened, might
have been rolled up and carried away like a carpet."</p>


<h4><i>Diminution and Extirpation of Birds.</i></h4>

<p>The general hostility of the European populace to the
smaller birds is, in part, the remote effect of the reaction created
by the game laws. When the restrictions imposed upon
the chase by those laws were suddenly removed in France,
the whole people at once commenced a destructive campaign
against every species of wild animal. Arthur Young, writing
in Provence, on the 30th of August, 1789, soon after the
National Assembly had declared the chase free, thus complains
of the annoyance he experienced from the use made by
the peasantry of their newly won liberty. "One would think
that every rusty firelock in all Provence was at work in the
indiscriminate destruction of all the birds. The wadding
buzzed by my ears, or fell into my carriage, five or six times
in the course of the day." * * "The declaration of the
Assembly that every man is free to hunt on his own land<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> * * has
filled all France with an intolerable cloud of sportsmen. * * The
declaration speaks of compensations and
indemnities [to the <i>seigneurs</i>], but the ungovernable populace
takes advantage of the abolition of the game laws and laughs
at the obligation imposed by the decree."</p>

<p>The French Revolution removed similar restrictions, with
similar results, in other countries. The habits then formed
have become hereditary on the Continent, and though game
laws still exist in England, there is little doubt that the blind
prejudices of the ignorant and half-educated classes in that
country against birds are, in some degree, at least, due to a
legislation, which, by restricting the chase of all game worth
killing, drives the unprivileged sportsman to indemnify himself
by slaughtering all wild life which is not reserved for the
amusement of his betters. Hence the lord of the manor buys
his partridges and his hares by sacrificing the bread of his
tenants, and so long as the farmers of Crawley are forbidden
to follow higher game, they will suicidally revenge themselves
by destroying the sparrows which protect their wheatfields.</p>

<p>On the Continent, and especially in Italy, the comparative
scarcity and dearness of animal food combine with the feeling
I have just mentioned to stimulate still further the destructive
passions of the fowler. In the Tuscan province of Grosseto,
containing less than 2,000 square miles, nearly 300,000 thrushes
and other small birds are annually brought to market.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Birds are less hardy in constitution, they possess less facility
of accommodation,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and they are more severely affected by
climatic excess than quadrupeds. Besides, they generally want
the means of shelter against the inclemency of the weather
and against pursuit by their enemies, which holes and dens
afford to burrowing animals and to some larger beasts of prey.
The egg is exposed to many dangers before hatching, and the
young bird is especially tender, defenceless, and helpless.
Every cold rain, every violent wind, every hailstorm during
the breeding season, destroys hundreds of nestlings, and the
parent often perishes with her progeny while brooding over it
in the vain effort to protect it.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The great proportional numbers
of birds, their migratory habits, and the ease with which
they may escape most dangers that beset them, would seem to
secure them from extirpation, and even from very great numerical
reduction. But experience shows that when not pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>tected
by law, by popular favor or superstition, or by other
special circumstances, they yield very readily to the hostile
influences of civilization, and, though the first operations of the
settler are favorable to the increase of many species, the great
extension of rural and of mechanical industry is, in a variety
of ways, destructive even to tribes not directly warred upon
by man.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Nature sets bounds to the disproportionate increase of
birds, while at the same time, by the multitude of their resources,
she secures them from extinction through her own
spontaneous agencies. Man both preys upon them and wantonly
destroys them. The delicious flavor of game birds, and
the skill implied in the various arts of the sportsman who
devotes himself to fowling, make them favorite objects of the
chase, while the beauty of their plumage, as a military and
feminine decoration, threatens to involve the sacrifice of the
last survivor of many once numerous species. Thus far, but
few birds described by ancient or modern naturalists are
known to have become absolutely extinct, though there are
some cases in which they are ascertained to have utterly disappeared
from the face of the earth in very recent times. The
most familiar instances are those of the dodo, a large bird
peculiar to the Mauritius or Isle of France, exterminated about
the year 1690, and now known only by two or three fragments
of skeletons, and the solitary, which inhabited the islands of
Bourbon and Rodriguez, but has not been seen for more than
a century. A parrot and some other birds of the Norfolk
Island group are said to have lately become extinct. The
wingless auk, <i>Alca impennis</i>, a bird remarkable for its excessive
fatness, was very abundant two or three hundred years
ago in the Faroe Islands, and on the whole Scandinavian seaboard.
The early voyagers found either the same or a closely
allied species, in immense numbers, on all the coasts and islands
of Newfoundland. The value of its flesh and its oil made
it one of the most important resources of the inhabitants of
those sterile regions, and it was naturally an object of keen
pursuit. It is supposed to be now completely extinct, and few
museums can show even its skeleton.</p>

<p>There seems to be strong reason to believe that our boasted
modern civilization is guiltless of one or two sins of extermination
which have been committed in recent ages. New Zealand
formerly possessed three species of dinornis, one of
which, called <i>moa</i> by the islanders, was much larger than the
ostrich. The condition in which the bones of these birds have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
been found and the traditions of the natives concur to prove
that, though the aborigines had probably extirpated them
before the discovery of New Zealand by the whites, they still
existed at a comparatively late period. The same remarks
apply to a winged giant the eggs of which have been brought
from Madagascar. This bird must have much exceeded the
dimensions of the moa, at least so far as we can judge from the
egg, which is eight times as large as the average size of the
ostrich egg, or about one hundred and fifty times that of
the hen.</p>

<p>But though we have no evidence that man has exterminated
many species of birds, we know that his persecutions
have caused their disappearance from many localities where
they once were common, and greatly diminished their numbers
in others. The cappercailzie, <i>Tetrao urogallus</i>, the finest
of the grouse family, formerly abundant in Scotland, had
become extinct in Great Britain, but has been reintroduced
from Sweden.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The ostrich is mentioned by all the old trav<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>ellers,
as common on the Isthmus of Suez down to the middle
of the seventeenth century. It appears to have frequented
Syria and even Asia Minor at earlier periods, but is now found
only in the seclusion of remoter deserts.</p>

<p>The modern increased facilities of transportation have
brought distant markets within reach of the professional hunter,
and thereby given a new impulse to his destructive propensities.
Not only do all Great Britain and Ireland contribute
to the supply of game for the British capital, but the
canvas-back duck of the Potomac, and even the prairie hen
from the basin of the Mississippi, may be found at the stalls
of the London poulterer. Kohl<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> informs us that on the coasts
of the North Sea, twenty thousand wild ducks are usually
taken in the course of the season in a single decoy, and sent to
the large maritime towns for sale. The statistics of the great
European cities show a prodigious consumption of game birds,
but the official returns fall far below the truth, because they
do not include the rural districts, and because neither the
poacher nor his customers report the number of his victims.
Reproduction, in cultivated countries, cannot keep pace with
this excessive destruction, and there is no doubt that all the
wild birds which are chased for their flesh or their plumage
are diminishing with a rapidity which justifies the fear that
the last of them will soon follow the dodo and the wingless
auk.</p>

<p>Fortunately the larger birds which are pursued for their
flesh or for their feathers, and those the eggs of which are used
as food, are, so far as we know the functions appointed to them
by nature, not otherwise specially useful to man, and, therefore,
their wholesale destruction is an economical evil only in
the same sense in which all waste of productive capital is an
evil. If it were possible to confine the consumption of game
fowl to a number equal to the annual increase, the world
would be a gainer, but not to the same extent as it would be

birds, which are of no real value as food, but which, as we
have seen, render a most important service by battling, in our
behalf, as well as in their own, against the countless legions of
humming and of creeping things, with which the prolific powers
of insect life would otherwise cover the earth.</p>


<h4><i>Introduction of Birds.</i></h4>

<p>Man has undesignedly introduced into new districts perhaps
fewer species of birds than of quadrupeds; but the distribution
of birds is very much influenced by the character of his
industry, and the transplantation of every object of agricultural
production is, at a longer or shorter interval, followed by
that of the birds which feed upon its seeds, or more frequently
upon the insects it harbors. The vulture, the crow, and other
winged scavengers, follow the march of armies as regularly as
the wolf. Birds accompany ships on long voyages, for the
sake of the offal which is thrown overboard, and, in such cases,
it might often happen that they would breed and become naturalized
in countries where they had been unknown before.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
There is a familiar story of an English bird which built its nest
in an unused block in the rigging of a ship, and made one or
two short voyages with the vessel while hatching its eggs.
Had the young become fledged while lying in a foreign harbor,
they would of course have claimed the rights of citizenship
in the country where they first took to the wing.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Some enthusiastic entomologist will, perhaps, by and by
discover that insects and worms are as essential as the larger
organisms to the proper working of the great terraqueous
machine, and we shall have as eloquent pleas in defence of
the mosquito, and perhaps even of the tzetze fly, as Toussenel
and Michelet have framed in behalf of the bird.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The silkworm
and the bee need no apologist; a gallnut produced by
the puncture of an insect on a Syrian oak is a necessary ingredient
in the ink I am writing with, and from my windows I
recognize the grain of the kermes and the cochineal in the gay
habiliments of the holiday groups beneath them. But agriculture,
too, is indebted to the insect and the worm. The ancients,
according to Pliny, were accustomed to hang branches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
of the wild fig upon the domestic tree, in order that the insects
which frequented the former might hasten the ripening of the
cultivated fig by their punctures&mdash;or, as others suppose, might
fructify it by transporting to it the pollen of the wild fruit&mdash;and
this process, called caprification, is not yet entirely obsolete.
The earthworms long ago made good their title to the respect
and gratitude of the farmer as well as of the angler. The
utility of the earthworms has been pointed out in many
scientific as well as in many agricultural treatises. The following
extract, cut from a newspaper, will answer my present
purpose:</p>

<p>"Mr. Josiah Parkes, the consulting engineer of the Royal
Agricultural Society of England, says that worms are great
assistants to the drainer, and valuable aids to the farmer in
keeping up the fertility of the soil. He says they love moist,
but not wet soils; they will bore down to, but not into water;
they multiply rapidly on land after drainage, and prefer a
deeply dried soil. On examining with Mr. Thomas Hammond,
of Penhurst, Kent, part of a field which he had deeply
drained, after long-previous shallow drainage, he found that
the worms had greatly increased in number, and that their
bores descended quite to the level of the pipes. Many worm
bores were large enough to receive the little finger. Mr.
Henry Handley had informed him of a piece of land near the
sea in Lincolnshire, over which the sea had broken and killed
all the worms&mdash;the field remained sterile until the worms
again inhabited it. He also showed him a piece of pasture
land near to his house, in which worms were in such numbers
that he thought their casts interfered too much with its produce,
which induced him to have it rolled at night in order to
destroy the worms. The result was, that the fertility of the
field greatly declined, nor was it restored until they had
recruited their numbers, which was aided by collecting and
transporting multitudes of worms from the fields.</p>

<p>"The great depth into which worms will bore, and from
which they push up fine fertile soil, and cast it on the surface,
has been admirably traced by Mr. C. Darwin, of Down, Kent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
who has shown that in a few years they have actually elevated
the surface of fields by a large layer of rich mould, several inches
thick&mdash;thus affording nourishment to the roots of grasses, and
increasing the productiveness of the soil."</p>

<p>It should be added that the writer quoted, and others who
have discussed the subject, have overlooked one very important
element in the fertilization produced by earthworms. I
refer to the enrichment of the soil by their excreta during life,
and by the decomposition of their remains when they die.
The manure thus furnished is as valuable as the like amount
of similar animal products derived from higher organisms, and
when we consider the prodigious numbers of these worms
found on a single square yard of some soils, we may easily see
that they furnish no insignificant contribution to the nutritive
material required for the growth of plants.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>The perforations of the earthworm mechanically affect the
texture of the soil and its permeability by water, and they
therefore have a certain influence on the form and character
of surface. But the geographical importance of insects proper,
as well as of worms, depends principally on their connection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
with vegetable life as agents of its fecundation, and of its
destruction.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> I am acquainted with no single fact so strikingly
illustrative of this importance, as the following statement
which I take from a notice of Darwin's volume, On Various
Contrivances by which British and Foreign Orchids are Fertilized
by Insects, in the <i>Saturday Review</i>, of October 18, 1862:
"The net result is, that some six thousand species of orchids
are absolutely dependent upon the agency of insects for their
fertilization. That is to say, were those plants unvisited by
insects, they would all rapidly disappear." What is true of
the orchids is more or less true of many other vegetable families.
We do not know the limits of this agency, and many
of the insects habitually regarded as unqualified pests, may
directly or indirectly perform functions as important to the
most valuable plants as the services rendered by certain tribes
to the orchids. I say directly or indirectly, because, besides
the other arrangements of nature for checking the undue multiplication
of particular species, she has established a police
among insects themselves, by which some of them keep down
or promote the increase of others; for there are insects, as
well as birds and beasts, of prey. The existence of an insect
which fertilizes a useful vegetable may depend on that of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
another, which constitutes his food in some stage of his life,
and this other again may be as injurious to some plant as his
destroyer is beneficial to another. The equation of animal and
vegetable life is too complicated a problem for human intelligence
to solve, and we can never know how wide a circle of
disturbance we produce in the harmonies of nature when we
throw the smallest pebble into the ocean of organic life.</p>

<p>This much, however, we seem authorized to conclude: as
often as we destroy the balance by deranging the original proportions
between different orders of spontaneous life, the law
of self-preservation requires us to restore the equilibrium, by
either directly returning the weight abstracted from one scale,
or removing a corresponding quantity from the other. In
other words, destruction must be either repaired by reproduction,
or compensated by new destruction in an opposite
quarter.</p>

<p>The parlor aquarium has taught even those to whom it is
but an amusing toy, that the balance of animal and vegetable
life must be preserved, and that the excess of either is fatal to
the other, in the artificial tank as well as in natural waters.
A few years ago, the water of the Cochituate aqueduct at
Boston became so offensive in smell and taste as to be quite
unfit for use. Scientific investigation found the cause in the
too scrupulous care with which aquatic vegetation had been
excluded from the reservoir, and the consequent death and
decay of the animalcul&aelig; which could not be shut out, nor live
in the water without the vegetable element.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Introduction of Insects.</i></h4>

<p>The general tendency of man's encroachments upon spontaneous
nature has been to increase insect life at the expense
of vegetation and of the smaller quadrupeds and birds.
Doubtless there are insects in all woods, but in temperate
climates they are comparatively few and harmless, and the
most numerous tribes which breed in the forest, or rather
in its waters, and indeed in all solitudes, are those which
little injure vegetation, such as mosquitoes, gnats, and the
like. With the cultivated plants of man come the myriad
tribes which feed or breed upon them, and agriculture not
only introduces new species, but so multiplies the number of
individuals as to defy calculation. Newly introduced vegetables
frequently escape for years the insect plagues which had
infested them in their native habitat; but the importation of
other varieties of the plant, the exchange of seed, or some
mere accident, is sure in the long run to carry the egg, the
larva, or the chrysalis to the most distant shores where the
plant assigned to it by nature as its possession has preceded it.
For many years after the colonization of the United States,
few or none of the insects which attack wheat in its different
stages of growth, were known in America. During the Revolutionary
war, the Hessian fly, <i>Cecidomyia destructor</i>, made its
appearance, and it was so called because it was first observed
in the year when the Hessian troops were brought over, and
was popularly supposed to have been accidentally imported
by those unwelcome strangers. Other destroyers of cereal
grains have since found their way across the Atlantic, and a
noxious European aphis has first attacked the American wheatfields
within the last four or five years. Unhappily, in these
cases of migration, the natural corrective of excessive multiplication,
the parasitic or voracious enemy of the noxious insect,
does not always accompany the wanderings of its prey, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the bane long precedes the antidote. Hence, in the United
States, the ravages of imported insects injurious to cultivated
crops, not being checked by the counteracting influences which
nature had provided to limit their devastations in the Old
World, are much more destructive than in Europe. It is not
known that the wheat midge is preyed upon in America by
any other insect, and in seasons favorable to it, it multiplies to
a degree which would prove almost fatal to the entire harvest,
were it not that, in the great territorial extent of the United
States, there is room for such differences of soil and climate as,
in a given year, to present in one State all the conditions favorable
to the increase of a particular insect, while in another, the
natural influences are hostile to it. The only apparent remedy
for this evil is, to balance the disproportionate development of
noxious foreign species by bringing from their native country
the tribes which prey upon them. This, it seems, has been
attempted. The United States' Census Report for 1860, p.
82, states that the New York Agricultural Society "has introduced
into this country from abroad certain parasites which
Providence has created to counteract the destructive powers
of some of these depredators."</p>

<p>This is, however, not the only purpose for which man has
designedly introduced foreign forms of insect life. The eggs
of the silkworm are known to have been brought from the
farther East to Europe in the sixth century, and new silk spinners
which feed on the castor oil bean and the ailanthus, have
recently been reared in France and in South America with
promising success. The cochineal, long regularly bred in
aboriginal America, has been transplanted to Spain, and both
the kermes insect and the cantharides have been transferred to
other climates than their own. The honey bee must be ranked
next to the silkworm in economical importance.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> This useful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
creature was carried to the United States by European colonists,
in the latter part of the seventeenth century; it did not
cross the Mississippi till the close of the eighteenth, and it is
only within the last five or six years that it has been transported
to California, where it was previously unknown. The
Italian stingless bee has very lately been introduced into the
United States.</p>

<p>The insects and worms intentionally transplanted by man
bear but a small proportion to those accidentally introduced
by him. Plants and animals often carry their parasites with
them, and the traffic of commercial countries, which exchange
their products with every zone and every stage of social existence,
cannot fail to transfer in both directions the minute
organisms that are, in one way or another, associated with
almost every object important to the material interests of man.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The tenacity of life possessed by many insects, their prodigious
fecundity, the length of time they often remain in the
different phases of their existence,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> the security of the retreats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
into which their small dimensions enable them to retire, are
all circumstances very favorable not only to the perpetuity of
their species, but to their transportation to distant climates
and their multiplication in their new homes. The teredo, so
destructive to shipping, has been carried by the vessels whose
wooden walls it mines to almost every part of the globe. The
termite, or white ant, is said to have been brought to Rochefort
by the commerce of that port a hundred years ago.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> This
creature is more injurious to wooden structures and implements
than any other known insect. It eats out almost the
entire substance of the wood, leaving only thin partitions
between the galleries it excavates in it; but as it never gnaws
through the surface to the air, a stick of timber may be almost
wholly consumed without showing any external sign of the
damage it has sustained. The termite is found also in other
parts of France, and particularly at Rochelle, where, thus far,
its ravages are confined to a single quarter of the city. A
borer, of similar habits, is not uncommon in Italy, and you
may see in that country, handsome chairs and other furniture
which have been reduced by this insect to a framework of
powder of post, covered, and apparently held together, by
nothing but the varnish.</p>

<p>The carnivorous, and often the herbivorous insects render
an important service to man by consuming dead and decaying
animal and vegetable matter, the decomposition of which
would otherwise fill the air with effluvia noxious to health.
Some of them, the grave-digger beetle, for instance, bury the
small animals in which they lay their eggs, and thereby prevent
the escape of the gases disengaged by putrefaction. The
prodigious rapidity of development in insect life, the great
numbers of the individuals in many species, and the voracity
of most of them while in the larva state, justify the appellation
of nature's scavengers which has been bestowed upon
them, and there is very little doubt that, in warm countries,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
they consume a much larger quantity of putrescent organic
material than the quadrupeds and the birds which feed upon
such aliment.</p>


<h4><i>Destruction of Insects.</i></h4>

<p>It is well known to naturalists, but less familiarly to common
observers, that the aquatic larv&aelig; of some insects constitute,
at certain seasons, a large part of the food of fresh-water
fish, while other larv&aelig;, in their turn, prey upon the spawn
and even the young of their persecutors.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The larv&aelig; of the
mosquito and the gnat are the favorite food of the trout in the
wooded regions where those insects abound.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Earlier in the
year the trout feeds on the larv&aelig; of the May fly, which is
itself very destructive to the spawn of the salmon, and hence,
by a sort of house-that-Jack-built, the destruction of the mos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>quito,
that feeds the trout that preys on the May fly that
destroys the eggs that hatch the salmon that pampers the epicure,
may occasion a scarcity of this latter fish in waters where
he would otherwise be abundant. Thus all nature is linked
together by invisible bonds, and every organic creature, however
low, however feeble, however dependent, is necessary to
the well-being of some other among the myriad forms of life
with which the Creator has peopled the earth.</p>

<p>I have said that man has promoted the increase of the
insect and the worm, by destroying the bird and the fish
which feed upon them. Many insects, in the four different
stages of their growth, inhabit in succession the earth, the
water, and the air. In each of these elements they have their
special enemies, and, deep and dark as are the minute recesses
in which they hide themselves, they are pursued to the remotest,
obscurest corners by the executioners that nature has
appointed to punish their delinquencies, and furnished with
cunning contrivances for ferreting out the offenders and dragging
them into the light of day. One tribe of birds, the woodpeckers,
seems to depend for subsistence almost wholly on
those insects which breed in dead or dying trees, and it is,
perhaps, needless to say that the injury these birds do the
forest is imaginary. They do not cut holes in the trunk of the
tree to prepare a lodgment for a future colony of boring larv&aelig;,
but to extract the worm which has already begun his mining
labors. Hence these birds are not found where the forester
removes trees as fast as they become fit habitations for such
insects. In clearing new lands in the United States, dead
trees, especially of the spike-leaved kinds, too much decayed
to serve for timber, and which, in that state, are worth little
for fuel, are often allowed to stand until they fall of themselves.
Such <i>stubs</i>, as they are popularly called, are filled
with borers, and often deeply cut by the woodpeckers, whose
strong bills enable them to penetrate to the very heart of the
tree and drag out the lurking larv&aelig;. After a few years, the
stubs fall, or, as wood becomes valuable, are cut and carried
off for firewood, and, at the same time, the farmer selects for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
felling, in the forest he has reserved as a permanent source of
supply of fuel and timber, the decaying trees which, like the
dead stems in the fields, serve as a home for both the worm
and his pursuer. We thus gradually extirpate this tribe of
insects, and, with them, the species of birds which subsist principally
upon them. Thus the fine, large, red-headed woodpecker,
<i>Picus erythrocephalus</i>, formerly very common in New
England, has almost entirely disappeared from those States,
since the dead trees are gone, and the apples, his favorite vegetable
food, are less abundant.</p>

<p>There are even large quadrupeds which feed almost exclusively
upon insects. The ant bear is strong enough to pull
down the clay houses built by the species of termites that
constitute his ordinary diet, and the curious ai-ai, a climbing
quadruped of Madagascar&mdash;of which I believe only a single
specimen, secured by Mr. Sandwith, has yet reached Europe&mdash;is
provided with a very slender, hook-nailed finger, long enough
to reach far into a hole in the trunk of a tree, and extract the
worm which bored it.</p>


<h4><i>Reptiles.</i></h4>

<p>But perhaps the most formidable foes of the insect, and
even of the small rodents, are the reptiles. The chameleon
approaches the insect perched upon the twig of a tree, with an
almost imperceptible slowness of motion, until, at the distance
of a foot, he shoots out his long, slimy tongue, and rarely fails
to secure the victim. Even the slow toad catches the swift
and wary housefly in the same manner; and in the warm
countries of Europe, the numerous lizards contribute very
essentially to the reduction of the insect population, which
they both surprise in the winged state upon walls and trees,
and consume as egg, worm, and chrysalis, in their earlier metamorphoses.
The serpents feed much upon insects, as well as
upon mice, moles, and small reptiles, including also other
snakes. The disgust and fear with which the serpent is so
universally regarded expose him to constant persecution by
man, and perhaps no other animal is so relentlessly sacrificed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
by him. In temperate climates, snakes are consumed by
scarcely any beast or bird of prey except the stork, and they
have few dangerous enemies but man, though in the tropics
other animals prey upon them.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> It is doubtful whether any
species of serpent has been exterminated within the human
period, and even the dense population of China has not been
able completely to rid itself of the viper. They have, however,
almost entirely disappeared from particular localities. The
rattlesnake is now wholly unknown in many large districts
where it was extremely common half a century ago, and Palestine
has long been, if not absolutely free from venomous
serpents, at least very nearly so.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>


<h4><i>Destruction of Fish.</i></h4>

<p>The inhabitants of the waters seem comparatively secure
from human pursuit or interference by the inaccessibility of
their retreats, and by our ignorance of their habits&mdash;a natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
result of the difficulty of observing the ways of creatures living
in a medium in which we cannot exist. Human agency has,
nevertheless, both directly and incidentally, produced great
changes in the population of the sea, the lakes, and the rivers,
and if the effects of such revolutions in aquatic life are apparently
of small importance in general geography, they are still
not wholly inappreciable. The great diminution in the abundance
of the larger fish employed for food or pursued for products
useful in the arts is familiar, and when we consider how the
vegetable and animal life on which they feed must be affected
by the reduction of their numbers, it is easy to see that their
destruction may involve considerable modifications in many
of the material arrangements of nature. The whale does not
appear to have been an object of pursuit by the ancients, for
any purpose, nor do we know when the whale fishery first
commenced.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> It was, however, very actively prosecuted in
the Middle Ages, and the Biscayans seem to have been particularly
successful in this as indeed in other branches of nautical
industry.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Five hundred years ago, whales abounded in every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
sea. They long since became so rare in the Mediterranean
as not to afford encouragement for the fishery as a regular
occupation; and the great demand for oil and whalebone for
mechanical and manufacturing purposes, in the present century,
has stimulated the pursuit of the "hugest of living creatures"
to such activity, that he has now almost wholly disappeared
from many favorite fishing grounds, and in others is
greatly diminished in numbers.</p>

<p>What special functions, besides his uses to man, are assigned
to the whale in the economy of nature, we do not
know; but some considerations, suggested by the character of
the food upon which certain species subsist, deserve to be
specially noticed. None of the great mammals grouped under
the general name of whale are rapacious. They all live upon
small organisms, and the most numerous species feed almost
wholly upon the soft gelatinous mollusks in which the sea
abounds in all latitudes. We cannot calculate even approximately
the number of the whales, or the quantity of organic
nutriment consumed by an individual, and of course we can
form no estimate of the total amount of animal matter withdrawn
by them, in a given period, from the waters of the sea.
It is certain, however, that it must have been enormous when
they were more abundant, and that it is still very considerable.
A very few years since, the United States had more than six
hundred whaling ships constantly employed in the Pacific,
and the product of the American whale fishery for the year
ending June 1st, 1860, was seven millions and a half of dollars.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
The mere bulk of the whales destroyed in a single year<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
by the American and the European vessels engaged in this
fishery would form an island of no inconsiderable dimensions,
and each one of those taken must have consumed, in the
course of his growth, many times his own weight of mollusks.
The destruction of the whales must have been followed by a
proportional increase of the organisms they feed upon, and if
we had the means of comparing the statistics of these humble
forms of life, for even so short a period as that between the
years 1760 and 1860, we should find a difference sufficient,
possibly, to suggest an explanation of some phenomena at
present unaccounted for.</p>

<p>For instance, as I have observed in another work,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> the
phosphorescence of the sea was unknown to ancient writers, or
at least scarcely noticed by them, and even Homer&mdash;who,
blind as tradition makes him when he composed his epics, had
seen, and marked, in earlier life, all that the glorious nature
of the Mediterranean and its coasts discloses to unscientific
observation&mdash;nowhere alludes to this most beautiful and striking
of maritime wonders. In the passage just referred to, I
have endeavored to explain the silence of ancient writers with
respect to this as well as other remarkable phenomena on psychological
grounds; but is it not possible that, in modern times,
the animalcul&aelig; which produce it may have immensely multiplied,
from the destruction of their natural enemies by man,
and hence that the gleam shot forth by their decomposition, or
by their living processes, is both more frequent and more brilliant
than in the days of classic antiquity?</p>

<p>Although the whale does not prey upon smaller creatures
resembling himself in form and habits, yet true fishes are
extremely voracious, and almost every tribe devours unspar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>ingly
the feebler species, and even the spawn and young of its
own. The enormous destruction of the pike, the trout family,
and other ravenous fish, as well as of the fishing birds, the seal,
and the otter, by man, would naturally have occasioned a great
increase in the weaker and more defenceless fish on which they
feed, had he not been as hostile to them also as to their persecutors.
We have little evidence that any fish employed as
human food has naturally multiplied in modern times, while
all the more valuable tribes have been immensely reduced in
numbers.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> This reduction must have affected the more voracious
species not used as food by man, and accordingly the
shark, and other fish of similar habits, though not objects of
systematic pursuit, are now comparatively rare in many waters
where they formerly abounded. The result is, that man has
greatly reduced the numbers of all larger marine animals,
and consequently indirectly favored the multiplication of the
smaller aquatic organisms which entered into their nutriment.
This change in the relations of the organic and inorganic
matter of the sea must have exercised an influence on the latter.
What that influence has been, we cannot say, still less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
can we predict what it will be hereafter; but its action is not
for that reason the less certain.</p>


<h4><i>Introduction and Breeding of Fish.</i></h4>

<p>The introduction and successful breeding of fish of foreign
species appears to have been long practised in China and was
not unknown to the Greeks and Romans. This art has been
revived in modern times, but thus far without any important
results, economical or physical, though there seems to be good
reason to believe it may be employed with advantage on an
extended scale. As in the case of plants, man has sometimes
undesignedly introduced new species of aquatic animals into
countries distant from their birthplace. The accidental escape
of the Chinese goldfish from ponds where they were bred as a
garden ornament, has peopled some European, and it is said
American streams with this species. Canals of navigation and
irrigation interchange the fish of lakes and rivers widely separated
by natural barriers, as well as the plants which drop
their seeds into the waters. The Erie Canal, as measured by
its own channel, has a length of about three hundred and sixty
miles, and it has ascending and descending locks in both directions.
By this route, the fresh-water fish of the Hudson and
the Upper Lakes, and some of the indigenous vegetables of
these respective basins, have intermixed, and the fauna and
flora of the two regions have now more species common to
both than before the canal was opened. Some accidental
attraction not unfrequently induces fish to follow a vessel for
days in succession, and they may thus be enticed into zones
very distant from their native habitat. Several years ago, I
was told at Constantinople, upon good authority, that a couple
of fish, of a species wholly unknown to the natives, had just
been taken in the Bosphorus. They were alleged to have followed
an English ship from the Thames, and to have been frequently
observed by the crew during the passage, but I was
unable to learn their specific character.</p>

<p>Many of the fish which pass the greater part of the year in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
salt water spawn in fresh, and some fresh-water species, the
common brook trout of New England for instance, which,
under ordinary circumstances, never visit the sea, will, if transferred
to brooks emptying directly into the ocean, go down
into the salt water after spawning time, and return again the
next season. Sea fish, the smelt among others, are said to
have been naturalized in fresh water, and some naturalists
have argued from the character of the fish of Lake Baikal, and
especially from the existence of the seal in that locality, that
all its inhabitants were originally marine species, and have
changed their habits with the gradual conversion of the
saline waters of the lake&mdash;once, as is assumed, a maritime bay&mdash;into
fresh.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The presence of the seal is hardly conclusive on
this point, for it is sometimes seen in Lake Champlain at the
distance of some hundreds of miles from even brackish water.
One of these animals was killed on the ice in that lake in February,
1810, another in February, 1846,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and remains of the
seal have been found at other times in the same waters.</p>

<p>The remains of the higher orders of aquatic animals are
generally so perishable that, even where most abundant, they
do not appear to be now forming permanent deposits of any
considerable magnitude; but it is quite otherwise with shell
fish, and, as we shall see hereafter, with many of the minute
limeworkers of the sea. There are, on the southern coast of
the United States, beds of shells so extensive that they were
formerly supposed to have been naturally accumulated, and
were appealed to as proofs of an elevation of the coast by geological
causes; but they are now ascertained to have been
derived from oysters, consumed in the course of long ages by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
the inhabitants of Indian towns. The planting of a bed of
oysters in a new locality might, very probably, lead, in time,
to the formation of a bank, which, in connection with other
deposits, might perceptibly affect the line of a coast, or, by
changing the course of marine currents, or the outlet of a
river, produce geographical changes of no small importance.
The transplantation of oysters to artificial ponds has long been
common, and it appears to have recently succeeded well on a
large scale in the open sea on the French coast. A great
extension of this fishery is hoped for, and it is now proposed to
introduce upon the same coast the American soft clam, which
is so abundant in the tide-washed beach sands of Long Island
Sound as to form an important article in the diet of the neighboring
population.</p>

<p>The intentional naturalization of foreign fish, as I have said,
has not thus far yielded important fruits; but though this particular
branch of what is called, not very happily, <i>pisciculture</i>,
has not yet established its claims to the attention of the physical
geographer or the political economist, the artificial breeding
of domestic fish has already produced very valuable results,
and is apparently destined to occupy an extremely conspicuous
place in the history of man's efforts to compensate his prodigal
waste of the gifts of nature. The restoration of the primitive
abundance of salt and fresh water fish, is one of the greatest
material benefits that, with our present physical resources,
governments can hope to confer upon their subjects. The
rivers, lakes, and seacoasts once restocked, and protected by
law from exhaustion by taking fish at improper seasons, by
destructive methods, and in extravagant quantities, would
continue indefinitely to furnish a very large supply of most
healthful food, which, unlike all domestic and agricultural
products, would spontaneously renew itself and cost nothing
but the taking. There are many sterile or wornout soils in
Europe so situated that they might, at no very formidable
cost, be converted into permanent lakes, which would serve not
only as reservoirs to retain the water of winter rains and snow,
and give it out in the dry season for irrigation, but as breed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>ing
ponds for fish, and would thus, without further cost, yield
a larger supply of human food than can at present be obtained
from them even at a great expenditure of capital and labor in
agricultural operations. The additions which might be made
to the nutriment of the civilized world by a judicious administration
of the resources of the waters, would allow some
restriction of the amount of soil at present employed for agricultural
purposes, and a corresponding extension of the area
of the forest, and would thus facilitate a return to primitive
geographical arrangements which it is important partially to
restore.</p>


<h4><i>Extirpation of Aquatic Animals.</i></h4>

<p>It does not seem probable that man, with all his rapacity
and all his enginery, will succeed in totally extirpating any
salt-water fish, but he has already exterminated at least one
marine warm-blooded animal&mdash;Steller's sea cow&mdash;and the
walrus, the sea lion, and other large amphibia, as well as the
principal fishing quadrupeds, are in imminent danger of extinction.
Steller's sea cow, <i>Rhytina Stelleri</i>, was first seen by
Europeans in the year 1741, on Bering's Island. It was a
huge amphibious mammal, weighing not less than eight thousand
pounds, and appears to have been confined exclusively to
the islands and coasts in the neighborhood of Bering's Strait.
Its flesh was very palatable, and the localities it frequented
were easily accessible from the Russian establishments in
Kamtschatka. As soon as its existence and character, and the
abundance of fur animals in the same waters, were made
known to the occupants of those posts by the return of the
survivors of Bering's expedition, so active a chase was commenced
against the amphibia of that region, that, in the course
of twenty-seven years, the sea cow, described by Steller as
extremely numerous in 1741, is believed to have been completely
extirpated, not a single individual having been seen
since the year 1768. The various tribes of seals in the Northern
and Southern Pacific, the walrus and the sea otter, are
already so reduced in numbers that they seem destined soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
to follow the sea cow, unless protected by legislation stringent
enough, and a police energetic enough, to repress the ardent
cupidity of their pursuers.</p>

<p>The seals, the otter tribe, and many other amphibia which
feed almost exclusively upon fish, are extremely voracious, and
of course their destruction or numerical reduction must have
favored the multiplication of the species of fish principally
preyed upon by them. I have been assured by the keeper of
several tamed seals that, if supplied at frequent intervals, each
seal would devour not less than fourteen pounds of fish, or
about a quarter of his own weight, in a day.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> A very intelligent
and observing hunter, who has passed a great part of his
life in the forest, after carefully watching the habits of the
fresh-water otter of the Northern American States, estimates
their consumption of fish at about four pounds per day.</p>

<p>Man has promoted the multiplication of fish by making
war on their brute enemies, but he has by no means thereby
compensated his own greater destructiveness.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> The bird and
beast of prey, whether on land or in the water, hunt only as
long as they feel the stimulus of hunger, their ravages are
limited by the demands of present appetite, and they do not
wastefully destroy what they cannot consume. Man, on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
contrary, angles to-day that he may dine to-morrow; he takes
and dries millions of fish on the banks of Newfoundland, that
the fervent Catholic of the shores of the Mediterranean may
have wherewithal to satisfy the cravings of the stomach during
next year's Lent, without imperilling his soul by violating the
discipline of the papal church; and all the arrangements of
his fisheries are so organized as to involve the destruction of
many more fish than are secured for human use, and the loss
of a large proportion of the annual harvest of the sea in the
process of curing, or in transportation to the places of its
consumption.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Fish are more affected than quadrupeds by slight and even
imperceptible differences in their breeding places and feeding
grounds. Every river, every brook, every lake stamps a special
character upon its salmon, its shad, and its trout, which is
at once recognized by those who deal in or consume them.
No skill can give the fish fattened by food selected and prepared
by man the flavor of those which are nourished at the
table of nature, and the trout of the artificial ponds in Germany
and Switzerland are so inferior to the brook fish of the
same species and climate, that it is hard to believe them identical.
The superior sapidity of the American trout to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
European species, which is familiar to every one acquainted
with both continents, is probably due less to specific difference
than to the fact that, even in the parts of the New World
which have been longest cultivated, wild nature is not yet
tamed down to the character it has assumed in the Old, and
which it will acquire in America also when her civilization
shall be as ancient as is now that of Europe.</p>

<p>Man has hitherto hardly anywhere produced such climatic
or other changes as would suffice of themselves totally to banish
the wild inhabitants of the dry land, and the disappearance of
the native birds and quadrupeds from particular localities is to
be ascribed quite as much to his direct persecutions as to the
want of forest shelter, of appropriate food, or of other conditions
indispensable to their existence. But almost all the processes
of agriculture, and of mechanical and chemical industry, are
fatally destructive to aquatic animals within reach of their
influence. When, in consequence of clearing the woods, the
changes already described as thereby produced in the beds
and currents of rivers, are in progress, the spawning grounds
of fish are exposed from year to year to a succession of mechanical
disturbances; the temperature of the water is higher
in summer, colder in winter, than when it was shaded and
protected by wood; the smaller organisms, which formed the
sustenance of the young fry, disappear or are reduced in numbers,
and new enemies are added to the old foes that preyed
upon them; the increased turbidness of the water in the
annual inundations chokes the fish; and, finally, the quickened
velocity of its current sweeps them down into the larger
rivers or into the sea, before they are yet strong enough to
support so great a change of circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Industrial oper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>ations
are not less destructive to fish which live or spawn in
fresh water. Milldams impede their migrations, if they do
not absolutely prevent them, the sawdust from lumber mills
clogs their gills, and the thousand deleterious mineral substances,
discharged into rivers from metallurgical, chemical,
and manufacturing establishments, poison them by shoals.</p>


<h4><i>Minute Organisms.</i></h4>

<p>Besides the larger creatures of the land and of the sea, the
quadrupeds, the reptiles, the birds, the amphibia, the crustacea,
the fish, the insects, and the worms, there are other
countless forms of vital being. Earth, water, the ducts and
fluids of vegetable and of animal life, the very air we breathe,
are peopled by minute organisms which perform most important
functions in both the living and the inanimate kingdoms
of nature. Of the offices assigned to these creatures, the most
familiar to common observation is the extraction of lime, and
more rarely, of silex, from the waters inhabited by them, and
the deposit of these minerals in a solid form, either as the
material of their habitations or as the exuvi&aelig; of their bodies.
The microscope and other means of scientific observation
assure us that the chalk beds of England and of France, the
coral reefs of marine waters in warm climates, vast calcareous
and silicious deposits in the sea and in many fresh-water
ponds, the common polishing earths and slates, and many
species of apparently dense and solid rock, are the work of the
humble organisms of which I speak, often, indeed, of animalcul&aelig;
so small as to become visible only by the aid of lenses
magnifying a hundred times the linear measures. It is pop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>ularly
supposed that animalcul&aelig;, or what are commonly embraced
under the vague name of infusoria, inhabit the water
alone, but the atmospheric dust transported by every wind
and deposited by every calm is full of microscopic life or of its
relics. The soil on which the city of Berlin stands, contains
at the depth of ten or fifteen feet below the surface, living
elaborators of silex;<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and a microscopic examination of a
handful of earth connected with the material evidences of
guilt has enabled the naturalist to point out the very spot
where a crime was committed. It has been computed that
one sixth part of the solid matter let fall by great rivers at
their outlets consists of still recognizable infusory shells and
shields, and, as the friction of rolling water must reduce much
of these fragile structures to a state of comminution which
even the microscope cannot resolve into distinct particles and
identify as relics of animal or of vegetable life, we must conclude
that a considerably larger proportion of river deposits is
really the product of animalcules.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that the chemical, and in many cases the
mechanical character of a great number of the objects important
in the material economy of human life, must be affected
by the presence of so large an organic element in their substance,
and it is equally obvious that all agricultural and all
industrial operations tend to disturb the natural arrangements
of this element, to increase or to diminish the special adaptation
of every medium in which it lives to the particular orders of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
being inhabited by it. The conversion of woodland into pasturage,
of pasture into plough land, of swamp or of shallow
sea into dry ground, the rotations of cultivated crops, must
prove fatal to millions of living things upon every rood of
surface thus deranged by man, and must, at the same time,
more or less fully compensate this destruction of life by promoting
the growth and multiplication of other tribes equally
minute in dimensions.</p>

<p>I do not know that man has yet endeavored to avail himself,
by artificial contrivances, of the agency of these wonderful
architects and manufacturers. We are hardly well enough
acquainted with their natural economy to devise means to turn
their industry to profitable account, and they are in very
many cases too slow in producing visible results for an age so
impatient as ours. The over-civilization of the nineteenth century
cannot wait for wealth to be amassed by infinitesimal
gains, and we are in haste to <i>speculate</i> upon the powers of
nature, as we do upon objects of bargain and sale in our trafficking
one with another. But there are still some cases where
the little we know of a life, whose workings are invisible to
the naked eye, suggests the possibility of advantageously
directing the efforts of troops of artisans that we cannot see.
Upon coasts occupied by the corallines, the reef-building animalcule
does not work near the mouth of rivers. Hence the
change of the outlet of a stream, often a very easy matter, may
promote the construction of a barrier to coast navigation at one
point, and check the formation of a reef at another, by diverting
a current of fresh water from the former and pouring it
into the sea at the latter. Cases may probably be found in
tropical seas, where rivers have prevented the working of the
coral animalcules in straits separating islands from each other
or from the mainland. The diversion of such streams might
remove this obstacle, and reefs consequently be formed which
should convert an archipelago into a single large island, and
finally join that to the neighboring continent.</p>

<p>Quatrefages proposed to destroy the teredo in harbors by
impregnating the water with a mineral solution fatal to them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Perhaps the labors of the coralline animals might be arrested
over a considerable extent of sea coast by similar means. The
reef builders are leisurely architects, but the precious coral
is formed so rapidly that the beds may be refished advantageously
as often as once in ten years.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> It does not seem
impossible that this coral might be transplanted to the American
coast, where the Gulf stream would furnish a suitable
temperature beyond the climatic limits that otherwise confine
its growth; and thus a new source of profit might perhaps be
added to the scanty returns of the hardy fisherman.</p>

<p>In certain geological formations, the diatomace&aelig; deposit, at
the bottom of fresh-water ponds, beds of silicious shields, valuable
as a material for a species of very light firebrick, in the
manufacture of water glass and of hydraulic cement, and ultimately,
doubtless, in many yet undiscovered industrial processes.
An attentive study of the conditions favorable to the
propagation of the diatomace&aelig; might perhaps help us to profit
directly by the productivity of this organism, and, at the same
time, disclose secrets of nature capable of being turned to
valuable account in dealing with silicious rocks, and the metal
which is the base of them. Our acquaintance with the obscure
and infinitesimal life of which I have now been treating is
very recent, and still very imperfect. We know that it is of
vast importance in the economy of nature, but we are so ambitious
to grasp the great, so little accustomed to occupy ourselves
with the minute, that we are not yet prepared to enter
seriously upon the question how far we can control and direct
the operations, not of unembodied physical forces, but of
beings, in popular apprehension, almost as immaterial as they.</p>

<p>Nature has no unit of magnitude by which she measures
her works. Man takes his standards of dimension from himself.
The hair's breadth was his minimum until the microscope
told him that there are animated creatures to which one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
of the hairs of his head is a larger cylinder than is the trunk
of the giant California redwood to him. He borrows his inch
from the breadth of his thumb, his palm and span from the
width of his hand and the spread of his fingers, his foot from
the length of the organ so named; his cubit is the distance
from the tip of his middle finger to his elbow, and his fathom
is the space he can measure with his outstretched arms. To a
being who instinctively finds the standard of all magnitudes
in his own material frame, all objects exceeding his own dimensions
are absolutely great, all falling short of them absolutely
small. Hence we habitually regard the whale and the
elephant as essentially large and therefore important creatures,
the animalcule as an essentially small and therefore
unimportant organism. But no geological formation owes its
origin to the labors or the remains of the huge mammal, while
the animalcule composes, or has furnished, the substance of
strata thousands of feet in thickness, and extending, in unbroken
beds, over many degrees of terrestrial surface. If man
is destined to inhabit the earth much longer, and to advance
in natural knowledge with the rapidity which has marked his
progress in physical science for the last two or three centuries,
he will learn to put a wiser estimate on the works of creation,
and will derive not only great instruction from studying the
ways of nature in her obscurest, humblest walks, but great
material advantage from stimulating her productive energies
in provinces of her empire hitherto regarded as forever inaccessible,
utterly barren.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<h4><i>The Habitable Earth Originally Wooded.</i></h4>

<p>There is good reason to believe that the surface of the habitable
earth, in all the climates and regions which have been
the abodes of dense and civilized populations, was, with few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
exceptions, already covered with a forest growth when it first
became the home of man. This we infer from the extensive
vegetable remains&mdash;trunks, branches, roots, fruits, seeds, and
leaves of trees&mdash;so often found in conjunction with works of
primitive art, in the boggy soil of districts where no forests
appear to have existed within the eras through which written
annals reach; from ancient historical records, which prove that
large provinces, where the earth has long been wholly bare of
trees, were clothed with vast and almost unbroken woods
when first made known to Greek and Roman civilization;<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
and from the state of much of North and of South America
when they were discovered and colonized by the European
race.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>These evidences are strengthened by observation of the
natural economy of our own time; for, whenever a tract of
country, once inhabited and cultivated by man, is abandoned
by him and by domestic animals,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and surrendered to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
undisturbed influences of spontaneous nature, its soil sooner or
later clothes itself with herbaceous and arborescent plants, and
at no long interval, with a dense forest growth. Indeed, upon
surfaces of a certain stability, and not absolutely precipitous
inclination, the special conditions required for the spontaneous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
propagation of trees may all be negatively expressed and
reduced to these three: exemption from defect or excess of
moisture, from perpetual frost, and from the depredations of
man and browsing quadrupeds. Where these requisites are
secured, the hardest rock is as certain to be overgrown with
wood as the most fertile plain, though, for obvious reasons, the
process is slower in the former than in the latter case. Lichens
and mosses first prepare the way for a more highly organized
vegetation. They retain the moisture of rains and dews, and
bring it to act, in combination with the gases evolved by their
organic processes, in decomposing the surface of the rocks they
cover; they arrest and confine the dust which the wind scatters
over them, and their final decay adds new material to the
soil already half formed beneath and upon them. A very thin
stratum of mould is sufficient for the germination of seeds of
the hardy evergreens and birches, the roots of which are often
found in immediate contact with the rock, supplying their
trees with nourishment from a soil derived from the decomposition
of their own foliage, or sending out long rootlets into
the surrounding earth in search of juices to feed them.</p>

<p>The eruptive matter of volcanoes, forbidding as is its aspect,
does not refuse nutriment to the woods. The refractory
lava of Etna, it is true, remains long barren, and that of the
great eruption of 1669 is still almost wholly devoid of vegetation.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
But the cactus is making inroads even here, while the
volcanic sand and molten rock thrown out by Vesuvius soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
becomes productive. George Sandys, who visited this latter
mountain in 1611, after it had reposed for several centuries,
found the throat of the volcano at the bottom of the crater
"almost choked with broken rocks and <i>trees</i> that are falne
therein." "Next to this," he continues, "the matter thrown
up is ruddy, light, and soft: more removed, blacke and ponderous:
the uttermost brow, that declineth like the seates in a
theater, flourishing with trees and excellent pasturage. The
midst of the hill is shaded with chestnut trees, and others
bearing sundry fruits."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>I am convinced that forests would soon cover many parts
of the Arabian and African deserts, if man and domestic animals,
especially the goat and the camel, were banished from
them. The hard palate and tongue and strong teeth and jaws
of this latter quadruped enable him to break off and masticate
tough and thorny branches as large as the finger. He is particularly
fond of the smaller twigs, leaves, and seedpods of
the <i>sont</i> and other acacias, which, like the American Robinia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
thrive well on dry and sandy soils, and he spares no tree the
branches of which are within his reach, except, if I remember
right, the tamarisk that produces manna. Young trees sprout
plentifully around the springs and along the winter watercourses
of the desert, and these are just the halting stations of
the caravans and their routes of travel. In the shade of these
trees, annual grasses and perennial shrubs shoot up, but are
mown down by the hungry cattle of the Bedouin, as fast as
they grow. A few years of undisturbed vegetation would
suffice to cover such points with groves, and these would gradually
extend themselves over soils where now scarcely any
green thing but the bitter colocynth and the poisonous foxglove
is ever seen.</p>


<h4><i>The Forest does not Furnish Food for Man.</i></h4>

<p>In a region absolutely covered with trees, human life could
not long be sustained, for want of animal and vegetable food.
The depths of the forest seldom furnish either bulb or fruit
suited to the nourishment of man; and the fowls and beasts
on which he feeds are scarcely seen except upon the margin
of the wood, for here only grow the shrubs and grasses, and
here only are found the seeds and insects, which form the sustenance
of the non-carnivorous birds and quadrupeds.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>First Removal of the Forest.</i></h4>

<p>As soon as multiplying man had filled the open grounds
along the margin of the rivers, the lakes, and the sea, and sufficiently
peopled the natural meadows and savannas of the
interior, where such existed,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> he could find room for expansion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
and further growth, only by the removal of a portion of the
forest that hemmed him in. The destruction of the woods,
then, was man's first geographical conquest, his first violation of
the harmonies of inanimate nature.</p>

<p>Primitive man had little occasion to fell trees for fuel, or,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
for the construction of dwellings, boats, and the implements
of his rude agriculture and handicrafts. Windfalls would
furnish a thin population with a sufficient supply of such
material, and if occasionally a growing tree was cut, the injury
to the forest would be too insignificant to be at all appreciable.</p>

<p>The accidental escape and spread of fire, or, possibly, the
combustion of forests by lightning, must have first suggested
the advantages to be derived from the removal of too abundant
and extensive woods, and, at the same time, have pointed
out a means by which a large tract of surface could readily be
cleared of much of this natural incumbrance. As soon as agriculture
had commenced at all, it would be observed that the
growth of cultivated plants, as well as of many species of wild
vegetation, was particularly rapid and luxuriant on soils which
had been burned over, and thus a new stimulus would be
given to the practice of destroying the woods by fire, as a
means of both extending the open grounds, and making the
acquisition of a yet more productive soil. After a few harvests
had exhausted the first rank fertility of the virgin mould,
or when weeds and briers and the sprouting roots of the trees
had begun to choke the crops of the half-subdued soil, the
ground would be abandoned for new fields won from the
forest by the same means, and the deserted plain or hillock
would soon clothe itself anew with shrubs and trees, to be
again subjected to the same destructive process, and again surrendered
to the restorative powers of vegetable nature.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
rude economy would be continued for generations, and wasteful
as it is, is still largely pursued in Northern Sweden, Swedish
Lapland, and sometimes even in France and the United States.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Effects of Fire on Forest Soil.</i></h4>

<p>Aside from the mechanical and chemical effects of the disturbance
of the soil by agricultural operations, and of the freer
admission of sun, rain, and air to the ground, the fire of itself
exerts an important influence on its texture and condition. It
consumes a portion of the half-decayed vegetable mould which
served to hold its mineral particles together and to retain the
water of precipitation, and thus loosens, pulverizes, and dries
the earth; it destroys reptiles, insects, and worms, with their
eggs, and the seeds of trees and of smaller plants; it supplies,
in the ashes which it deposits on the surface, important elements
for the growth of a new forest clothing, as well as of the
usual objects of agricultural industry; and by the changes thus
produced, it fits the ground for the reception of a vegetation
different in character from that which had spontaneously covered
it. These new conditions help to explain the natural
succession of forest crops, so generally observed in all woods
cleared by fire and then abandoned. There is no doubt, however,
that other influences contribute to the same result,
because effects more or less analogous follow when the trees
are destroyed by other causes, as by high winds, by the woodman's
axe, and even by natural decay.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Effects of Destruction of the Forest.</i></h4>

<p>The physico-geographical effects of the destruction of the
forests may be divided into two great classes, each having an
important influence on vegetable and on animal life in all their
manifestations, as well as on every branch of rural economy
and productive industry, and, therefore, on all the material
interests of man. The first respects the meteorology of the
countries exposed to the action of these influences; the second,
their superficial geography, or, in other words, configuration,
consistence, and clothing of surface.</p>

<p>For reasons assigned in the first chapter, the meteorological
or climatic branch of the subject is the most obscure, and the
conclusions of physicists respecting it are, in a great degree,
inferential only, not founded on experiment or direct observation.
They are, as might be expected, somewhat discordant,
though certain general results are almost universally accepted,
and seem indeed too well supported to admit of serious question.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Electrical Influence of Trees.</i></h4>

<p>The properties of trees, singly and in groups, as exciters or
conductors of electricity, and their consequent influence upon
the electrical state of the atmosphere, do not appear to have
been much investigated; and the conditions of the forest itself
are so variable and so complicated, that the solution of any
general problem respecting its electrical influence would be a
matter of extreme difficulty. It is, indeed, impossible to suppose
that a dense cloud, a sea of vapor, can pass over miles of
surface bristling with good conductors, without undergoing
some change of electrical condition. Hypothetical cases may
be put in which the character of the change could be deduced
from the known laws of electrical action. But in actual
nature, the elements are too numerous for us to seize. The
true electrical condition of neither cloud nor forest could be
known, and it could seldom be predicted whether the vapors
would be dissolved as they floated over the wood, or discharged
upon it in a deluge of rain. With regard to possible electrical
influences of the forest, wider still in their range of action, the
uncertainty is even greater. The data which alone could lead
to certain, or even probable, conclusions are wanting, and we
should, therefore, only embarrass our argument by any attempt
to discuss this meteorological element, important as it may be,
in its relations of cause and effect to more familiar and better
understood meteoric phenomena. It may, however, be observed
that hail storms&mdash;which were once generally supposed, and are
still held by many, to be produced by a specific electrical
action, and which, at least, are always accompanied by electrical
disturbances&mdash;are believed, in all countries particularly
exposed to that scourge, to have become more frequent and
destructive in proportion as the forests have been cleared.
Caimi observes: "When the chains of the Alps and the Apennines
had not yet been stripped of their magnificent crown of
woods, the May hail, which now desolates the fertile plains of
Lombardy, was much less frequent; but since the general
prostration of the forest, these tempests are laying waste even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the mountain soils whose older inhabitants scarcely knew this
plague.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> The <i>paragrandini</i>,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> which the learned curate of
Rivolta advised to erect, with sheaves of straw set up vertically,
over a great extent of cultivated country, are but a Liliputian
image of the vast paragrandini, pines, larches, firs,
which nature had planted by millions on the crests and ridges
of the Alps and the Apennines."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> "Electrical action being
diminished," says Meguscher, "and the rapid congelation of
vapors by the abstraction of heat being impeded by the influence
of the woods, it is rare that hail or waterspouts are
produced, within the precincts of a large forest when it is
assailed by the tempest."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Arthur Young was told that since
the forests which covered the mountains between the Riviera
and the county of Montferrat had disappeared, hail had become
more destructive in the district of Acqui,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and it appears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
upon good authority, that a similar increase in the frequency
and violence of hail storms in the neighborhood of Saluzzo
and Mondov&igrave;, the lower part of the Valtelline, and the territory
of Verona and Vicenza, is probably to be ascribed to a
similar cause.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>


<h4><i>Chemical Influence of the Forest.</i></h4>

<p>We know that the air in a close apartment is appreciably
affected through the inspiration and expiration of gases by
plants growing in it. The same operations are performed on
a gigantic scale by the forest, and it has even been supposed
that the absorption of carbon, by the rank vegetation of earlier
geological periods, occasioned a permanent change in the constitution
of the terrestrial atmosphere.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> To the effects thus
produced, are to be added those of the ultimate gaseous decomposition
of the vast vegetable mass annually shed by trees, and
of their trunks and branches when they fall a prey to time.
But the quantity of gases thus abstracted from and restored
to the atmosphere is inconsiderable&mdash;infinitesimal, one might
almost say&mdash;in comparison with the ocean of air from which
they are drawn and to which they return; and though the
exhalations from bogs, and other low grounds covered with
decaying vegetable matter, are highly deleterious to human
health, yet, in general, the air of the forest is hardly chemically
distinguishable from that of the sand plains, and we can
as little trace the influence of the woods in the analysis of the
atmosphere, as we can prove that the mineral ingredients of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
land springs sensibly affect the chemistry of the sea. I may,
then, properly dismiss the chemical, as I have done the electrical
influences of the forest, and treat them both alike, if not
as unimportant agencies, at least as quantities of unknown
value in our meteorological equation.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Our inquiries upon
this branch of the subject will accordingly be limited to the
thermometrical and hygrometrical influences of the woods.</p>


<h4><i>Influence of the Forest, considered as Inorganic Matter,
on Temperature.</i></h4>

<p>The evaporation of fluids, and the condensation and expansion
of vapors and gases, are attended with changes of temperature;
and the quantity of moisture which the air is capable
of containing, and, of course, the evaporation, rise and fall
with the thermometer. The hygroscopical and the thermoscopical
conditions of the atmosphere are, therefore, inseparably
connected as reciprocally dependent quantities, and
neither can be fully discussed without taking notice of the
other. But the forest, regarded purely as inorganic matter,
and without reference to its living processes of absorption and
exhalation of water and gases, has, as an absorbent, a radiator
and a conductor of heat, and as a mere covering of the ground,
an influence on the temperature of the air and the earth, which
may be considered by itself.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<h4>a. <i>Absorbing and Emitting Surface.</i></h4>

<p>A given area of ground, as estimated by the every-day rule
of measurement in yards or acres, presents always the same
apparent quantity of absorbing, radiating, and reflecting surface;
but the real extent of that surface is very variable,
depending, as it does, upon its configuration, and the bulk and
form of the adventitious objects it bears upon it; and, besides,
the true superficies remaining the same, its power of absorption,
radiation, reflection, and conduction of heat will be much
affected by its consistence, its greater or less humidity, and its
color, as well as by its inclination of plane and exposure.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
An acre of chalk, rolled hard and smooth, would have great
reflecting power, but its radiation would be much increased by
breaking it up into clods, because the actually exposed surface
would be greater, though the outline of the field remained the
same. The area of a triangle being equal to its base multiplied
by half the length of a perpendicular let fall from its
apex, it follows that the entire superficies of the triangular
faces of a quadrangular pyramid, the perpendicular of whose
sides should be twice the length of the base, would be four
times the area of the ground it covered, and would add to the
field on which it stood so much surface capable of receiving
and emitting heat, though, in consequence of obliquity and
direction of plane, its actual absorption and emission of heat
might not be so great as that of an additional quantity of level
ground containing four times the area of its base. The lesser
inequalities which always occur in the surface of ordinary
earth affect in the same way its quantity of superficies acting
upon the temperature of the atmosphere, and acted on by it,
though the amount of this action and reaction is not susceptible
of measurement.</p>

<p>Analogous effects are produced by other objects, of whatever
form or character, standing or lying upon the earth, and
no solid can be placed upon a flat piece of ground, without
itself exposing a greater surface than it covers. This applies,
of course, to forest trees and their leaves, and indeed to all
vegetables, as well as to other prominent bodies. If we suppose
forty trees to be planted on an acre, one being situated in
the centre of every square of two rods the side, and to grow
until their branches and leaves everywhere meet, it is evident
that, when in full foliage, the trunks, branches, and leaves
would present an amount of thermoscopic surface much
greater than that of an acre of bare earth; and besides this,
the fallen leaves lying scattered on the ground, would some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>what
augment the sum total.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> On the other hand, the growing
leaves of trees generally form a succession of stages, or,
loosely speaking, layers, corresponding to the animal growth
of the branches, and more or less overlying each other. This
disposition of the foliage interferes with that free communication
between sun and sky above, and leaf surface below, on
which the amount of radiation and absorption of heat depends.
From all these considerations, it appears that though the
effective thermoscopic surface of a forest in full leaf does not
exceed that of bare ground in the same proportion as does its
measured superficies, yet the actual quantity of area capable
of receiving and emitting heat must be greater in the former
than in the latter case.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>It must further be remembered that the form and texture
of a given surface are important elements in determining its
thermoscopic character. Leaves are porous, and admit air
and light more or less freely into their substance; they are
generally smooth and even glazed on one surface; they are
usually covered on one or both sides with spicul&aelig;, and they
very commonly present one or more acuminated points in their
outline&mdash;all circumstances which tend to augment their power
of emitting heat by reflection or radiation. Direct experiment
on growing trees is very difficult, nor is it in any case practicable
to distinguish how far a reduction of temperature produced
by vegetation is due to radiation, and how far to exhalation
of the fluids of the plant in a gaseous form; for both
processes usually go on together. But the frigorific effect of
leafy structure is well observed in the deposit of dew and the
occurrence of hoarfrost on the foliage of grasses and other
small vegetables, and on other objects of similar form and con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>sistence,
when the temperature of the air a few yards above
has not been brought down to the dew point, still less to 32&deg;,
the degree of cold required to congeal dew to frost.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>


<h4>b. <i>Trees as Conductors of Heat.</i></h4>

<p>We are also to take into account the action of the forest as
a conductor of heat between the atmosphere and the earth.
In the most important countries of America and Europe, and
especially in those which have suffered most from the destruction
of the woods, the superficial strata of the earth are colder
in winter, and warmer in summer than those a few inches
lower, and their shifting temperature approximates to the
atmospheric mean of the respective seasons. The roots of
large trees penetrate beneath the superficial strata, and reach
earth of a nearly constant temperature, corresponding to the
mean for the entire year. As conductors, they convey the
heat of the atmosphere to the earth when the earth is colder
than the air, and transmit it in the contrary direction when
the temperature of the earth is higher than that of the atmosphere.
Of course, then, as conductors, they tend to equalize
the temperature of the earth and the air.</p>


<h4>c. <i>Trees in Summer and Winter.</i></h4>

<p>In countries where the questions I am considering have
the greatest practical importance, a very large proportion, if
not a majority, of the trees are of deciduous foliage, and their
radiating as well as their shading surface is very much greater
in summer than in winter. In the latter season, they little
obstruct the reception of heat by the ground or the radiation
from it; whereas, in the former, they often interpose a complete<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
canopy between the ground and the sky, and materially interfere
with both processes.</p>


<h4>d. <i>Dead Products of Trees.</i></h4>

<p>Besides this various action of standing trees considered as
inorganic matter, the forest exercises, by the annual moulting
of its foliage, still another influence on the temperature of the
earth, and, consequently, of the atmosphere which rests upon
it. If you examine the constitution of the superficial soil in a
primitive or an old and undisturbed artificially planted wood,
you find, first, a deposit of undecayed leaves, twigs, and seeds,
lying in loose layers on the surface; then, more compact beds
of the same materials in incipient, and, as you descend, more
and more advanced stages of decomposition; then, a mass of
black mould, in which traces of organic structure are hardly
discoverable except by microscopic examination; then, a
stratum of mineral soil, more or less mixed with vegetable
matter carried down into it by water, or resulting from the
decay of roots; and, finally, the inorganic earth or rock itself.
Without this deposit of the dead products of trees, this latter
would be the superficial stratum, and as its powers of absorption,
radiation, and conduction of heat would differ essentially
from those of the layers with which it has been covered by the
droppings of the forest, it would act upon the temperature of
the atmosphere, and be acted on by it, in a very different way
from the leaves and mould which rest upon it. Leaves, still
entire, or partially decayed, are very indifferent conductors of
heat, and, therefore, though they diminish the warming influence
of the summer sun on the soil below them, they, on the
other hand, prevent the escape of heat from that soil in winter,
and, consequently, in cold climates, even when the ground
is not covered by a protecting mantle of snow, the earth does
not freeze to as great a depth in the wood as in the open field.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<h4>e. <i>Trees as a Shelter to Ground to the Leeward.</i></h4>

<p>The action of the forest, considered merely as a mechanical
shelter to grounds lying to the leeward of it, would seem to be
an influence of too restricted a character to deserve much
notice; but many facts concur to show that it is an important
element in local climate, and that it is often a valuable means
of defence against the spread of miasmatic effluvia, though, in
this last case, it may exercise a chemical as well as a mechanical
agency. In the report of a committee appointed in 1836
to examine an article of the forest code of France, Arago
observes: "If a curtain of forest on the coasts of Normandy
and of Brittany were destroyed, these two provinces would
become accessible to the winds from the west, to the mild
breezes of the sea. Hence a decrease of the cold of winter.
If a similar forest were to be cleared on the eastern border
of France, the glacial east wind would prevail with greater
strength, and the winters would become more severe. Thus
the removal of a belt of wood would produce opposite effects
in the two regions."<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>This opinion receives confirmation from an observation of
Dr. Dwight, who remarks, in reference to the woods of New
England: "Another effect of removing the forest will be the
free passage of the winds, and among them of the southern
winds, over the surface. This, I think, has been an increasing
fact within my own remembrance. As the cultivation of the
country has extended farther to the north, the winds from the
south have reached distances more remote from the ocean, and
imparted their warmth frequently, and in such degrees as,
forty years since, were in the same places very little known.
This fact, also, contributes to lengthen the summer, and to
shorten the winter-half of the year."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>It is thought in Italy that the clearing of the Apennines
has very materially affected the climate of the valley of the
Po. It is asserted in Le Alpi che cingono l'Italia that: "In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
consequence of the felling of the woods on the Apennines, the
sirocco prevails greatly on the right bank of the Po, in the
Parmesan territory, and in a part of Lombardy; it injures the
harvests and the vineyards, and sometimes ruins the crops of
the season. To the same cause many ascribe the meteorological
changes in the precincts of Modena and of Reggio. In
the communes of these districts, where formerly straw roofs
resisted the force of the winds, tiles are now hardly sufficient;
in others, where tiles answered for roofs, large slabs of stone
are now ineffectual; and in many neighboring communes the
grapes and the grain are swept off by the blasts of the south
and southwest winds."</p>

<p>On the other hand, according to the same authority, the
pinery of Porto, near Ravenna&mdash;which is 33 kilometres long,
and is one of the oldest pine woods in Italy&mdash;having been
replanted with resinous trees after it was unfortunately cut,
has relieved the city from the sirocco to which it had become
exposed, and in a great degree restored its ancient climate.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>The felling of the woods on the Atlantic coast of Jutland
has exposed the soil not only to drifting sands, but to sharp
sea winds, that have exerted a sensible deteriorating effect on
the climate of that peninsula, which has no mountains to serve
at once as a barrier to the force of the winds, and as a storehouse
of moisture received by precipitation or condensed from
atmospheric vapors.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that the effect of the forest, as a mechanical
impediment to the passage of the wind, would extend to a very
considerable distance above its own height, and hence protect
while standing, or lay open when felled, a much larger surface
than might at first thought be supposed. The atmosphere,
movable as are its particles, and light and elastic as are its
masses, is nevertheless held together as a continuous whole by the
gravitation of its atoms and their consequent pressure on each
other, if not by attraction between them, and, therefore, an obstruction
which mechanically impedes the movement of a given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
stratum of air, will retard the passage of the strata above and
below it. To this effect may often be added that of an ascending
current from the forest itself, which must always exist
when the atmosphere within the wood is warmer than the
stratum of air above it, and must be of almost constant occurrence
in the case of cold winds, from whatever quarter, because
the still air in the forest is slow in taking up the temperature
of the moving columns and currents around and above it.
Experience, in fact, has shown that mere rows of trees, and
even much lower obstructions, are of essential service in defending
vegetation against the action of the wind. Hardy
proposes planting, in Algeria, belts of trees at the distance of
one hundred m&egrave;tres from each other, as a shelter which experience
had proved to be useful in France.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> "In the valley of
the Rhone," says Becquerel, "a simple hedge, two m&egrave;tres in
height, is a sufficient protection for a distance of twenty-two
m&egrave;tres."<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The mechanical shelter acts, no doubt, chiefly as
a defence against the mechanical force of the wind, but its uses
are by no means limited to this effect. If the current of air
which it resists moves horizontally, it would prevent the access
of cold or parching blasts to the ground for a great distance;
and did the wind even descend at a large angle with the surface,
still a considerable extent of ground would be protected
by a forest to the windward of it. If we suppose the trees of
a wood to have a mean height of only twenty yards, they
would often beneficially affect the temperature or the moisture
of a belt of land two or three hundred yards in width, and thus
perhaps rescue valuable crops from destruction.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>The local retardation of spring so much complained of in
Italy, France, and Switzerland, and the increased frequency of
late frosts at that season, appear to be ascribable to the admission
of cold blasts to the surface, by the felling of the forests
which formerly both screened it as by a wall, and communicated
the warmth of their soil to the air and earth to the
leeward. Caimi states that since the cutting down of the
woods of the Apennines, the cold winds destroy or stunt the
vegetation, and that, in consequence of "the usurpation of
winter on the domain of spring," the district of Mugello has
lost all its mulberries, except the few which find in the lee of
buildings a protection like that once furnished by the forest.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>"It is proved," says Clav&eacute;, "&Eacute;tudes," p. 44, "that the department
of Ard&egrave;che, which now contains not a single considerable
wood, has experienced within thirty years a climatic
disturbance, of which the late frosts, formerly unknown in the
country, are one of the most melancholy effects. Similar
results have been observed in the plain of Alsace, in consequence
of the denudation of several of the crests of the
Vosges."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>Dussard, as quoted by Ribbe,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> maintains that even the
<i>mistral</i>, or northwest wind, whose chilling blasts are so fatal
to tender vegetation in the spring, "is the child of man, the
result of his devastations." "Under the reign of Augustus,"
continues he, "the forests which protected the C&eacute;vennes were
felled, or destroyed by fire, in mass. A vast country, before
covered with impenetrable woods&mdash;powerful obstacles to the
movement and even to the formation of hurricanes&mdash;was suddenly
denuded, swept bare, stripped, and soon after, a scourge
hitherto unknown struck terror over the land from Avignon
to the Bouches du Rhone, thence to Marseilles, and then extended
its ravages, diminished indeed by a long career which
had partially exhausted its force, over the whole maritime
frontier. The people thought this wind a curse sent of God.
They raised altars to it and offered sacrifices to appease its
rage." It seems, however, that this plague was less destructive
than at present, until the close of the sixteenth century,
when further clearings had removed most of the remaining
barriers to its course. Up to that time, the northwest wind
appears not to have attained to the maximum of specific effect
which now characterizes it as a local phenomenon. Extensive
districts, from which the rigor of the seasons has now banished
valuable crops, were not then exposed to the loss of their harvests
by tempests, cold, or drought. The deterioration was
rapid in its progress. Under the Consulate, the clearings had
exerted so injurious an effect upon the climate, that the cultivation
of the olive had retreated several leagues, and since the
winters and springs of 1820 and 1836, this branch of rural
industry has been abandoned in a great number of localities
where it was advantageously pursued before. The orange now
flourishes only at a few sheltered points of the coast, and it is
threatened even at Ily&egrave;res, where the clearing of the hills near
the town has proved very prejudicial to this valuable tree.</p>

<p>Marchand informs us that, since the felling of the woods,
late spring frosts are more frequent in many localities north<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
of the Alps; that fruit trees thrive well no longer, and that it
is difficult to raise young trees.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>


<h4>f. <i>Trees as a Protection against Malaria.</i></h4>

<p>The influence of forests in preventing the diffusion of miasmatic
vapors is a matter of less familiar observation, and perhaps
does not come strictly within the sphere of the present
inquiry, but its importance will justify me in devoting some
space to the subject. "It has been observed" (I quote again
from Becquerel) "that humid air, charged with miasmata, is
deprived of them in passing through the forest. Rigaud de
Lille observed localities in Italy where the interposition of a
screen of trees preserved everything beyond it, while the
unprotected grounds were subject to fevers."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Few European
countries present better opportunities for observation on this
point than Italy, because in that kingdom the localities exposed
to miasmatic exhalations are numerous, and belts of
trees, if not forests, are of so frequent occurrence that their
efficacy in this respect can be easily tested. The belief that
rows of trees afford an important protection against malarious
influences is very general among Italians best qualified by
intelligence and professional experience to judge upon the
subject. The commissioners appointed to report on the measures
to be adopted for the improvement of the Tuscan Maremme
advised the planting of three or four rows of poplars,
<i>Populus alba</i>, in such directions as to obstruct the currents of
air from malarious localities, and thus intercept a great proportion
of the pernicious exhalations."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Lieutenant Maury
even believed that a few rows of sunflowers, planted between the
Washington Observatory and the marshy banks of the Potomac,
had saved the inmates of that establishment from the
intermittent fevers to which they had been formerly liable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Maury's experiments have been repeated in Italy. Large
plantations of sunflowers have been made upon the alluvial
deposits of the Oglio, above its entrance into the Lake of Iseo
near Pisogne, and it is said with favorable results to the health
of the neighborhood.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> In fact, the generally beneficial effects
of a forest wall or other vegetable screen, as a protection against
noxious exhalations from marshes or other sources of disease
situated to the windward of them, are very commonly admitted.</p>

<p>It is argued that, in these cases, the foliage of trees and of
other vegetables exercises a chemical as well as a mechanical
effect upon the atmosphere, and some, who allow that forests
may intercept the circulation of the miasmatic effluvia of
swampy soils, or even render them harmless by decomposing
them, contend, nevertheless, that they are themselves active
causes of the production of malaria. The subject has been a
good deal discussed in Italy, and there is some reason to think
that under special circumstances the influence of the forest in
this respect may be prejudicial rather than salutary, though
this does not appear to be generally the case.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> It is, at all
events, well known that the great swamps of Virginia and the
Carolinas, in climates nearly similar to that of Italy, are healthy
even to the white man, so long as the forests in and around
them remain, but become very insalubrious when the woods
are felled.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>


<h4><i>The Forest, as Inorganic Matter, tends to mitigate Extremes.</i></h4>

<p>The surface which trees and leaves present augments the
general superficies of the earth exposed to the absorption of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
heat, and increases the radiating and reflecting area in the
same proportion. It is impossible to measure the relative
value of these two elements&mdash;increase of absorbing and increase
of emitting surface&mdash;as thermometrical influences,
because they exert themselves under infinitely varied conditions;
and it is equally impossible to make a quantitative estimate
of any partial, still more of the total effect of the forest,
considered as dead matter, on the temperature of the atmosphere,
and of the portion of the earth's surface acted on by it.
But it seems probable that its greatest influence in this respect
is due to its character of a screen, or mechanical obstacle to
the transmission of heat between the earth and the air; and
this is equally true of the standing tree and of the dead
foliage which it deposits in successive layers at its foot.</p>

<p>The complicated action of trees and their products, as dead
absorbents, radiators, reflectors, and conductors of heat, and as
interceptors of its transmission, is so intimately connected with
their effects upon the humidity of the air and the earth, and
with all their living processes, that it is difficult to separate
the former from the latter class of influences; but upon the
whole, the forest must thus far be regarded as tending to mitigate
extremes, and, therefore, as an equalizer of temperature.</p>


<h4>TREES AS ORGANISMS.</h4>

<h4><i>Specific Heat.</i></h4>

<p>Trees, considered as organisms, produce in themselves, or
in the air, a certain amount of heat, by absorbing and condensing
atmospheric vapor, and they exert an opposite influence
by absorbing water and exhaling it in the form of vapor;
but there is still another mode by which their living processes
may warm the air around them, independently of the thermometric
effects of condensation and evaporation. The vital
heat of a dozen persons raises the temperature of a room. If
trees possess a specific temperature of their own, an organic
power of generating heat, like that with which the warm-blooded
animals are gifted, though by a different process, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
certain amount of weight is to be ascribed to this element, in
estimating the action of the forest upon atmospheric temperature.</p>

<p>"Observation shows," says Meguscher, "that the wood of
a living tree maintains a temperature of +12&deg; or 13&deg; Cent.
[= 54&deg;, 56&deg; Fahr.] when the temperature of the air stands at
3&deg;, 7&deg;, and 8&deg; [=37&deg;, 46&deg;, 47&deg; F.] above zero, and that the
internal warmth of the tree does not rise and fall in proportion
to that of the atmosphere. So long as the latter is below 18&deg;
[= 67&deg; Fahr.], that of the tree is always the highest; but if the
temperature of the air rises to 18&deg;, that of the vegetable growth
is the lowest. Since, then, trees maintain at all seasons a constant
mean temperature of 12&deg; [= 54&deg; Fahr.], it is easy to see
why the air in contact with the forest must be warmer in winter,
cooler in summer, than in situations where it is deprived
of that influence."<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>Boussingault remarks: "In many flowers there has been
observed a very considerable evolution of heat, at the approach
of fecundation. In certain <i>arums</i> the temperature rises to 40&deg;
or 50&deg; Cent. [= 104&deg; or 122&deg; Fahr.]. It is very probable that
this phenomenon is general, and varies only in the intensity
with which it is manifested."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>If we suppose the fecundation of the flowers of forest trees
to be attended with a tenth only of this calorific power, they
could not fail to exert an important influence on the warmth
of the atmospheric strata in contact with them.</p>

<p>In a paper on Meteorology by Professor Henry, published
in the United States Patent Office Report for 1857, p. 504,
that distinguished physicist observes: "As a general deduction
from chemical and mechanical principles, we think no
change of temperature is ever produced where the actions
belonging to one or both of these principles are not present.
Hence, in midwinter, when all vegetable functions are dormant,
we do not believe that any heat is developed by a tree,
or that its interior differs in temperature from its exterior<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
further than it is protected from the external air. The
experiments which have been made on this point, we think,
have been directed by a false analogy. During the active
circulation of the sap and the production of new tissue,
variations of temperature belonging exclusively to the plant
may be observed; but it is inconsistent with general principles
that heat should be generated where no change is
taking place."</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that moisture is given out by trees
and evaporated in extremely cold winter-weather, and unless
new fluid were supplied from the roots, the tree would be
exhausted of its juices before winter was over. But this is not
observed to be the fact, and, though the point is disputed,
respectable authorities declare that "wood felled in the depth
of winter is the heaviest and fullest of sap."<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Warm weather
in winter, of too short continuance to affect the temperature
of the ground sensibly, stimulates a free flow of sap in the
maple. Thus, in the last week of December, 1862, and the
first week of January, 1863, sugar was made from that tree, in
various parts of New England. "A single branch of a tree,
admitted into a warm room in winter through an aperture in
a window, opened its buds and developed its leaves while the
rest of the tree in the external air remained in its winter
sleep."<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The roots of forest trees in temperate climates,
remain, for the most part, in a moist soil, of a temperature not
much below the annual mean, through the whole winter; and
we cannot account for the uninterrupted moisture of the tree,
unless we suppose that the roots furnish a constant supply of
water.</p>

<p>Atkinson describes a ravine in a valley in Siberia, which
was filled with ice to the depth of twenty-five feet. Poplars
were growing in this ice, which was thawed to the distance of
some inches from the stem. But the surface of the soil beneath
it must have remained still frozen, for the holes around the
trees were full of water resulting from its melting, and this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
would have escaped below if the ground had been thawed. In
this case, although the roots had not thawed the thick covering
of earth above them, the trunks must have melted the ice in
contact with them. The trees, when observed by Atkinson,
were in full leaf, but it does not appear at what period the ice
around their stems had melted.</p>

<p><a name="Page_159_2" id="Page_159_2"></a>From these facts, and others of the like sort, it would seem
that "all vegetable functions are" not absolutely "dormant"
in winter, and, therefore, that trees may give out <i>some</i> heat at
that season. But, however this may be, the "circulation of
the sap" commences at a very early period in the spring, and
the temperature of the air in contact with trees may then be
sufficiently affected by heat evolved in the vital processes of
vegetation, to raise the thermometric mean of wooded countries
for that season, and, of course, for the year.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>


<h4><i>Total Influence of the Forest on Temperature.</i></h4>

<p>It has not yet been found practicable to measure, sum up,
and equate the total influence of the forest, its processes and its
products, dead and living, upon temperature, and investigators
differ much in their conclusions on this subject. It seems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
probable that in every particular case the result is, if not determined,
at least so much modified by local conditions which are
infinitely varied, that no general formula is applicable to the
question.</p>

<p>In the report to which I referred on page 149, Gay-Lussac
says: "In my opinion we have not yet any positive proof that
the forest has, in itself, any real influence on the climate of a
great country, or of a particular locality. By closely examining
the effects of clearing off the woods, we should perhaps
find that, far from being an evil, it is an advantage; but these
questions are so complicated when they are examined in a
climatological point of view, that the solution of them is very
difficult, not to say impossible."</p>

<p>Becquerel, on the other hand, considers it certain that in
tropical climates, the destruction of the forests is accompanied
with an elevation of the mean temperature, and he thinks it
highly probable that it has the same effect in the temperate
zones. The following is the substance of his remarks on this
subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Forests act as frigorific causes in three ways:</p>

<p>"1. They shelter the ground against solar irradiation and
maintain a greater humidity.</p>

<p>"2. They produce a cutaneous transpiration by the leaves.</p>

<p>"3. They multiply, by the expansion of their branches, the
surfaces which are cooled by radiation.</p>

<p>"These three causes acting with greater or less force, we
must, in the study of the climatology of a country, take into
account the proportion between the area of the forests and the
surface which is bared of trees and covered with herbs and
grasses.</p>

<p>"We should be inclined to believe <i>&agrave; priori</i>, according to
the foregoing considerations, that the clearing of the woods,
by raising the temperature and increasing the dryness of the
air, ought to react on climate. There is no doubt that, if the
vast desert of the Sahara were to become wooded in the course
of ages, the sands would cease to be heated as much as at the
present epoch, when the mean temperature is twenty-nine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
degrees [centigrade, = 85&deg; Fahr.]. In that case, the ascending
currents of warm air would cease, or be less warm, and
would not contribute, by descending in our latitudes, to soften
the climate of Western Europe. Thus the clearing of a great
country may react on the climates of regions more or less
remote from it.</p>

<p>"The observations by Boussingault leave no doubt on this
point. This writer determined the mean temperature of
wooded and of cleared points, under the same latitude, and at
the same elevation above the sea, in localities comprised between
the eleventh degree of north and the fifth degree of
south latitude, that is to say, in the portion of the tropics
nearest to the equator, and where radiation tends powerfully
during the night to lower the temperature under a sky without
clouds."<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The result of these observations, which has been pretty
generally adopted by physicists, is that the mean temperature
of cleared land in the tropics appears to be about one degree
centigrade, or a little less than two degrees of Fahrenheit,
above that of the forest. On page 147 of the volume just
cited, Becquerel argues that, inasmuch as the same and sometimes
a greater difference is found in favor of the open ground,
at points within the tropics so elevated as to have a temperate
or even a polar climate, we must conclude that the forests in
Northern America exert a refrigerating influence equally powerful.
But the conditions of the soil are so different in the two
regions compared, that I think we cannot, with entire confidence,
reason from the one to the other, and it is much to be
desired that observations be made on the summer and winter
temperature of both the air and the ground in the depths of
the North American forests, before it is too late.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<h4>INFLUENCE OF FORESTS ON THE HUMIDITY OF THE AIR AND THE EARTH.</h4>

<h4>a. <i>As Inorganic Matter.</i></h4>

<p>The most important influence of the forest on climate is,
no doubt, that which it exercises on the humidity of the air
and the earth, and this climatic action it exerts partly as dead,
partly as living matter. By its interposition as a curtain between
the sky and the ground, it intercepts a large proportion
of the dew and the lighter showers, which would otherwise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
moisten the surface of the soil, and restores it to the atmosphere
by evaporation; while in heavier rains, the large drops
which fall upon the leaves and branches are broken into
smaller ones, and consequently strike the ground with less
mechanical force, or are perhaps even dispersed into vapor
without reaching it.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> As a screen, it prevents the access of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the sun's rays to the earth, and, of course, an elevation of temperature
which would occasion a great increase of evaporation.
As a mechanical obstruction, it impedes the passage of
air currents over the ground, which, as is well known, is one
of the most efficient agents in promoting evaporation and the
refrigeration resulting from it.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> In the forest, the air is almost
quiescent, and moves only as local changes of temperature
affect the specific gravity of its particles. Hence there is often
a dead calm in the woods when a furious blast is raging in the
open country at a few yards' distance. The denser the forest&mdash;as
for example, where it consists of spike-leaved trees, or is
thickly intermixed with them&mdash;the more obvious is its effect,
and no one can have passed from the field to the wood in cold,
windy weather, without having remarked it.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>The vegetable mould, resulting from the decomposition of
leaves and of wood, carpets the ground with a spongy covering
which obstructs the evaporation from the mineral earth below,
drinks up the rains and melting snows that would otherwise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
flow rapidly over the surface and perhaps be conveyed to the
distant sea, and then slowly gives out, by evaporation, infiltration,
and percolation, the moisture thus imbibed. The roots,
too, penetrate far below the superficial soil, conduct the water
along their surface to the lower depths to which they reach,
and thus serve to drain the superior strata and remove the
moisture out of the reach of evaporation.</p>


<h4>b. <i>The Forest as Organic.</i></h4>

<p>These are the principal modes in which the humidity of
the atmosphere is affected by the forest regarded as lifeless
matter. Let us inquire how its organic processes act upon
this meteorological element.</p>

<p>The commonest observation shows that the wood and bark
of living trees are always more or less pervaded with watery
and other fluids, one of which, the sap, is very abundant in
trees of deciduous foliage when the buds begin to swell and
the leaves to develop themselves in the spring. The outer
bark of most trees is of a corky character, not admitting the
absorption of much moisture from the atmosphere through its
pores, and we can hardly suppose that the buds are able to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
extract from the air a much larger supply. The obvious conclusion
as to the source from which the extraordinary quantity
of sap at this season is derived, is that to which scientific
investigation leads us, namely, that it is absorbed from the
earth by the roots, and thence distributed to all parts of the
plant. Popular opinion, indeed, supposes that all the vegetable
fluids, during the entire period of growth, are thus drawn
from the bosom of the earth, and that the wood and other
products of the tree are wholly formed from matter held in
solution in the water abstracted by the roots from the ground.
This is an error, for, not only is the solid matter of the tree, in
a certain proportion not important to our present inquiry,
received from the atmosphere in a gaseous form, through the
pores of the leaves and of the young shoots, but water in the
state of vapor is absorbed and contributed to the circulation,
by the same organs.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The amount of water taken up by the
roots, however, is vastly greater than that imbibed through the
leaves, especially at the season when the juices are most abun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>dant,
and when, as we have seen, the leaves are yet in embryo.
The quantity of water thus received from the air and the earth,
in a single year, by a wood of even a hundred acres, is very
great, though experiments are wanting to furnish the data for
even an approximate estimate of its measure; for only the
vaguest conclusions can be drawn from the observations which
have been made on the imbibition and exhalation of water by
trees and other plants reared in artificial conditions diverse
from those of the natural forest.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>


<h4><i>Wood Mosses and Fungi.</i></h4>

<p>Besides the water drawn by the roots from the earth and
the vapor absorbed by the leaves from the air, the wood
mosses and fungi, which abound in all dense forests, take up
a great quantity of moisture from the atmosphere when it is
charged with humidity, and exhale it again when the air is
dry. These humble organizations, which play a more important
part in regulating the humidity of the air than writers on
the forest have usually assigned to them, perish with the trees
they grow on; but, in many situations, nature provides a compensation
for the tree mosses in ground species, which, on cold
soils, especially those with a northern exposure, spring up
abundantly both before the woods are felled, and when the
land is cleared and employed for pasturage, or deserted.
These mosses discharge a portion of the functions appropriated
to the wood, and while they render the soil of improved lands
much less fit for agricultural use, they, at the same time, prepare
it for the growth of a new harvest of trees, when the
infertility they produce shall have driven man to abandon it
and suffer it to relapse into the hands of nature.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Flow of Sap.</i></h4>

<p>The amount of sap which can be withdrawn from living
trees furnishes, not indeed a measure of the quantity of water
sucked up by their roots from the ground&mdash;for we cannot
extract from a tree its whole moisture&mdash;but numerical data
which may aid the imagination to form a general notion of the
powerful action of the forest as an absorbent of humidity from
the earth.</p>

<p>The only forest tree known to Europe and North America,
the sap of which is largely enough applied to economical uses
to have made the amount of its flow a matter of practical
importance and popular observation, is the sugar maple, <i>Acer
saccharinum</i>, of the Anglo-American Provinces and States.
In the course of a single "sugar season," which lasts ordinarily
from twenty-five to thirty days, a sugar maple two feet in
diameter will yield not less than twenty gallons of sap, and
sometimes much more.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> This, however, is but a trifling pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>portion
of the water abstracted from the earth by the roots
during this season, when the yet undeveloped leaves can hardly
absorb an appreciable quantity of vapor from the atmosphere;<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
for all this fluid runs from two or three incisions or
auger holes, so narrow as to intercept the current of comparatively
few sap vessels, and besides, experience shows that large
as is the quantity withdrawn from the circulation, it is relatively
too small to affect very sensibly the growth of the tree.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
The number of large maple trees on an acre is frequently not
less than fifty,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and of course the quantity of moisture ab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>stracted
from the soil by this tree alone is measured by thousands
of gallons to the acre. The sugar orchards, as they are
called, contain also many young maples too small for tapping,
and numerous other trees&mdash;two of which, at least, the black
birch, <i>Betula lenta</i>, and yellow birch, <i>Betula excelsa</i>, both
very common in the same climate, are far more abundant in
sap than the maple<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>&mdash;are scattered among the sugar trees;
for the North American native forests are remarkable for the
mixture of their crops.</p>

<p>The sap of the maple, and of other trees with deciduous
leaves which grow in the same climate, flows most freely in
the early spring, and especially in clear weather, when the
nights are frosty and the days warm; for it is then that the
melting snows supply the earth with moisture in the justest
proportion, and that the absorbent power of the roots is stimulated
to its highest activity.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>When the buds are ready to burst, and the green leaves
begin to show themselves beneath their scaly covering, the
ground has become drier, the thirst of the roots is quenched,
and the flow of sap from them to the stem is greatly diminished.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>


<h4><i>Absorption and Exhalation of Moisture.</i></h4>

<p>The leaves now commence the process of absorption, and
imbibe both uncombined gases and an unascertained but perhaps
considerable quantity of watery vapor from the humid
atmosphere of spring which bathes them.</p>

<p>The organic action of the tree, as thus far described, tends
to the desiccation of air and earth; but when we consider
what volumes of water are daily absorbed by a large tree, and
how small a proportion of the weight of this fluid consists of
matter which enters into new combinations, and becomes a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
part of the solid framework of the vegetable, or a component
of its deciduous products, it is evident that the superfluous
moisture must somehow be carried off almost as rapidly as it
flows into the tree.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> At the very commencement of vegeta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>tion
in spring, some of this fluid certainly escapes through the
buds, the nascent foliage, and the pores of the barb, and vegetable
physiology tells us that there is a current of sap toward
the roots as well as from them.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> I do not know that the
exudation of water into the earth, through the bark or at the
extremities of these latter organs, has been directly proved,
but the other known modes of carrying off the surplus do not
seem adequate to dispose of it at the almost leafless period
when it is most abundantly received, and it is therefore difficult
to believe that the roots do not, to some extent, drain as
well as flood the watercourses of their stem. Later in the season
the roots absorb less, and the now developed leaves exhale a
vastly increased quantity of moisture into the air. In any
event, all the water derived by the growing tree from the
atmosphere and the ground is returned again by transpiration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
or exudation, after having surrendered to the plant the small
proportion of matter required for vegetable growth which it
held in solution or suspension.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> The hygrometrical equilibrium
is then restored, so far as this: the tree yields up again
the moisture it had drawn from the earth and the air, though
it does not return it each to each; for the vapor carried off by
transpiration greatly exceeds the quantity of water absorbed by
the foliage from the atmosphere, and the amount, if any, carried
back to the ground by the roots.</p>

<p>The evaporation of the juices of the plant, by whatever
process effected, takes up atmospheric heat and produces refrigeration.
This effect is not less real, though much less
sensible, in the forest than in meadow or pasture land, and it
cannot be doubted that the local temperature is considerably
affected by it. But the evaporation that cools the air diffuses
through it, at the same time, a medium which powerfully
resists the escape of heat from the earth by radiation. Visible
vapors or clouds, it is well known, prevent frosts by obstruct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>ing
radiation, or rather by reflecting back again the heat
radiated by the earth, just as any mechanical screen would
do. On the other hand, clouds intercept the rays of the sun
also, and hinder its heat from reaching the earth. The invisible
vapors given out by leaves impede the passage of heat
reflected and radiated by the earth and by all terrestrial
objects, but oppose much less resistance to the transmission of
direct solar heat, and indeed the beams of the sun seem more
scorching when received through clear air charged with uncondensed
moisture than after passing through a dry atmosphere.
Hence the reduction of temperature by the evaporation of
moisture from vegetation, though sensible, is less than it would
be if water in the gaseous state were as impervious to heat given
out by the sun as to that emitted by terrestrial objects.</p>

<p>The hygroscopicity of vegetable mould is much greater than
that of any mineral earth, and therefore the soil of the forest
absorbs more atmospheric moisture than the open ground. The
condensation of the vapor by absorption disengages heat, and
consequently raises the temperature of the soil which absorbs
it. Von Babo found the temperature of sandy earth thus
elevated from 20&deg; to 27&deg; centigrade, making a difference of
nearly thirteen degrees of Fahrenheit, and that of soil rich
in humus from 20&deg; to 31&deg; centigrade, a difference of almost
twenty degrees of Fahrenheit.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>


<h4><i>Balance of Conflicting Influences.</i></h4>

<p>We have shown that the forest, considered as dead matter,
tends to diminish the moisture of the air, by preventing the
sun's rays from reaching the ground and evaporating the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
water that falls upon the surface, and also by spreading over
the earth a spongy mantle which sucks up and retains the
humidity it receives from the atmosphere, while, at the same
time, this covering acts in the contrary direction by accumulating,
in a reservoir not wholly inaccessible to vaporizing
influences, the water of precipitation which might otherwise
suddenly sink deep into the bowels of the earth, or flow by
superficial channels to other climatic regions. We now see
that, as a living organism, it tends, on the one hand, to diminish
the humidity of the air by absorbing moisture from it, and,
on the other, to increase that humidity by pouring out into the
atmosphere, in a vaporous form, the water it draws up through
its roots. This last operation, at the same time, lowers the
temperature of the air in contact with or proximity to the
wood, by the same law as in other cases of the conversion of
water into vapor.</p>

<p>As I have repeatedly said, we cannot measure the value of
any one of these elements of climatic disturbance, raising or
lowering of temperature, increase or diminution of humidity,
nor can we say that in any one season, any one year, or any
one fixed cycle, however long or short, they balance and compensate
each other. They are sometimes, but certainly not
always, contemporaneous in their action, whether their tendency
is in the same or in opposite directions, and, therefore,
their influence is sometimes cumulative, sometimes conflicting;
but, upon the whole, their general effect seems to be to mitigate
extremes of atmospheric heat and cold, moisture and
drought. They serve as equalizers of temperature and humidity,
and it is highly probable that, in analogy with most
other works and workings of nature, they, at certain or uncertain
periods, restore the equilibrium which, whether as lifeless
masses or as living organisms, they may have temporarily
disturbed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>When, therefore, man destroyed these natural harmonizers
of climatic discords, he sacrificed an important conservative
power, though it is far from certain that he has thereby
affected the mean, however much he may have exaggerated
the extremes of atmospheric temperature and humidity, or, in
other words, may have increased the range and lengthened the
scale of thermometric and hygrometric variation.</p>


<h4><i>Influence of the Forest on Temperature and Precipitation.</i></h4>

<p>Aside from the question of compensation, it does not seem
probable that the forests sensibly affect the total quantity of
precipitation, or the general mean of atmospheric temperature
of the globe, or even that they had this influence when their
extent was vastly greater than at present. The waters cover
about three fourths of the face of the earth,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> and if we deduct
the frozen zones, the peaks and crests of lofty mountains and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
their craggy slopes, the Sahara and other great African and
Asiatic deserts, and all such other portions of the solid surface
as are permanently unfit for the growth of wood, we shall find
that probably not one tenth of the total superficies of our
planet was ever, at any one time in the present geological
epoch, covered with forests. Besides this, the distribution of
forest land, of desert, and of water, is such as to reduce the
possible influence of the former to a low expression; for the
forests are, in large proportion, situated in cold or temperate
climates, where the action of the sun is comparatively feeble
both in elevating temperature and in promoting evaporation;
while, in the torrid zone, the desert and the sea&mdash;the latter of
which always presents an evaporable surface&mdash;enormously preponderate.
It is, upon the whole, not probable that so small
an extent of forest, so situated, could produce an appreciable
influence on the <i>general</i> climate of the globe, though it might
appreciably affect the local action of all climatic elements.
The total annual amount of solar heat absorbed and radiated
by the earth, and the sum of terrestrial evaporation and atmospheric
precipitation must be supposed constant; but the distribution
of heat and of humidity is exposed to disturbance in
both time and place, by a multitude of local causes, among
which the presence or absence of the forest is doubtless one.</p>

<p>So far as we are able to sum up the general results, it would
appear that, in countries in the temperate zone still chiefly
covered with wood, the summers would be cooler, moister,
shorter, the winters milder, drier, longer, than in the same
regions after the removal of the forest. The slender historical
evidence we possess seems to point to the same conclusion,
though there is some conflict of testimony and of opinion on
this point, and some apparently well-established exceptions to
particular branches of what appears to be the general law.</p>

<p>One of these occurs both in climates where the cold of
winter is severe enough to freeze the ground to a considerable
depth, as in Sweden and the Northern States of the American
Union, and in milder zones, where the face of the earth is
exposed to cold mountain winds, as in some parts of Italy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
of France; for there, as we have seen, the winter is believed
to extend itself into the months which belong to the spring,
later than at periods when the forest covered the greater part
of the ground.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> More causes than one doubtless contribute to
this result; but in the case of Sweden and the United States,
the most obvious explanation of the fact is to be found in the
loss of the shelter afforded to the ground by the thick coating
of leaves which the forest sheds upon it, and the snow which
the woods protect from blowing away, or from melting in the
brief thaws of winter. I have already remarked that bare
ground freezes much deeper than that which is covered by
beds of leaves, and when the earth is thickly coated with
snow, the strata frozen before it fell begin to thaw. It is not
uncommon to find the ground in the woods, where the snow
lies two or three feet deep, entirely free from frost, when the
atmospheric temperature has been for several weeks below the
freezing point, and for some days even below the zero of Fahrenheit.
When the ground is cleared and brought under cultivation,
the leaves are ploughed into the soil and decomposed,
and the snow, especially upon knolls and eminences, is blown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
off, or perhaps half thawed, several times during the winter.
The water from the melting snow runs into the depressions,
and when, after a day or two of warm sunshine or tepid rain,
the cold returns, it is consolidated to ice, and the bared ridges
and swells of earth are deeply frozen.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> It requires many days
of mild weather to raise the temperature of soil in this condition,
and of the air in contact with it, to that of the earth in
the forests of the same climatic region. Flora is already plaiting
her sylvan wreath before the corn flowers which are to
deck the garland of Ceres have waked from their winter's
sleep; and it is not a popular error to believe that, where
man has substituted his artificial crops for the spontaneous
harvest of nature, spring delays her coming.</p>

<p>In many cases, the apparent change in the period of the
seasons is a purely local phenomenon, which is probably compensated
by a higher temperature in other months, without
any real disturbance of the average thermometrical equilibrium.
We may easily suppose that there are analogous partial
deviations from the general law of precipitation; and,
without insisting that the removal of the forest has diminished
the sum total of snow and rain, we may well admit that it has
lessened the quantity which annually falls within particular
limits. Various theoretical considerations make this probable,
the most obvious argument, perhaps, being that drawn from
the generally admitted fact, that the summer and even the
mean temperature of the forest is below that of the open country
in the same latitude. If the air in a wood is cooler than
that around it, it must reduce the temperature of the atmospheric
stratum immediately above it, and, of course, whenever
a saturated current sweeps over it, it must produce precipitation
which would fall upon or near it.</p>

<p>But the subject is so exceedingly complex and difficult,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
that it is safer to regard it as a historical problem, or at least
as what lawyers call a mixed question of law and fact, than to
attempt to decide it upon <i>&agrave; priori</i> grounds. Unfortunately the
evidence is conflicting in tendency, and sometimes equivocal in
interpretation, but I believe that a majority of the foresters
and physicists who have studied the question are of opinion
that in many, if not in all cases, the destruction of the woods
has been followed by a diminution in the annual quantity of
rain and dew. Indeed, it has long been a popularly settled
belief that vegetation and the condensation and fall of atmospheric
moisture are reciprocally necessary to each other, and
even the poets sing of</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Afric's barren sand,</span><br />
Where nought can grow, because it raineth not,<br />
And where no rain can fall to bless the land,<br />
Because nought grows there.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Before stating the evidence on the general question and
citing the judgments of the learned upon it, however, it is well
to remark that the comparative variety or frequency of inundations
in earlier and later centuries is not necessarily, in most
cases not probably, entitled to any weight whatever, as a proof
that more or less rain fell formerly than now; because the
accumulation of water in the channel of a river depends far
less upon the quantity of precipitation in its valley, than upon
the rapidity with which it is conducted, on or under the surface
of the ground, to the central artery that drains the basin.
But this point will be more fully discussed in a subsequent
chapter.</p>

<p>There is another important observation which may properly
be introduced here. It is not universally, or even generally
true, that the atmosphere returns its humidity to the local<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
source from which it receives it. The air is constantly in
motion,</p>

<p class="poem">
&mdash;&mdash;howling tempests scour amain<br />
From sea to land, from land to sea;<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a><br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">and, therefore, it is always probable that the evaporation
drawn up by the atmosphere from a given river, or sea, or
forest, or meadow, will be discharged by precipitation, not at
or near the point where it rose, but at a distance of miles,
leagues, or even degrees. The currents of the upper air are
invisible, and they leave behind them no landmark to record
their track. We know not whence they come, or whither
they go. We have a certain rapidly increasing acquaintance
with the laws of general atmospheric motion, but of the origin
and limits, the beginning and end of that motion, as it manifests
itself at any particular time and place, we know nothing.
We cannot say where or when the vapor, exhaled to-day from
the lake on which we float, will be condensed and fall;
whether it will waste itself on a barren desert, refresh upland
pastures, descend in snow on Alpine heights, or contribute to
swell a distant torrent which shall lay waste square miles of
fertile corn land; nor do we know whether the rain which
feeds our brooklets is due to the transpiration from a neighboring
forest, or to the evaporation from a far-off sea. If,
therefore, it were proved that the annual quantity of rain and
dew is now as great on the plains of Castile, for example, as it
was when they were covered with the native forest, it would
by no means follow that those woods did not augment the
amount of precipitation elsewhere.</p>

<p>But I return to the question. Beginning with the latest
authorities, I cite a passage from Clav&eacute;.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> After arguing that
we cannot reason from the climatic effects of the forest in tropical
and sub-tropical countries as to its influence in temperate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
latitudes, the author proceeds: "The action of the forests on
rain, a consequence of that which they exercise on temperature,
is difficult to estimate in our climate, but is very pronounced
in hot countries, and is established by numerous
examples. M. Boussingault states that in the region comprised
between the Bay of Cupica and the Gulf of Guayaquil,
which is covered with immense forests, the rains are almost
continual, and that the mean temperature of this humid country
rises hardly to twenty-six degrees (= 80&deg; Fahr.). M. Blanqui,
in his 'Travels in Bulgaria,' informs us that at Malta rain has
become so rare, since the woods were cleared to make room
for the growth of cotton, that at the time of his visit in October,
1841, not a drop of rain had fallen for three years.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> The
terrible droughts which desolate the Cape Verd Islands must
also be attributed to the destruction of the forests. In the
Island of St. Helena, where the wooded surface has considerably
extended within a few years, it has been observed that
the rain has increased in the same proportion. It is now in
quantity double what it was during the residence of Napoleon.
In Egypt, recent plantations have caused rains, which hitherto
were almost unknown."</p>

<p>Schacht<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> observes: "In wooded countries, the atmosphere
is generally humid, and rain and dew fertilize the soil. As
the lightning rod abstracts the electric fluid from the stormy
sky, so the forest attracts to itself the rain from the clouds,
which, in falling, refreshes not it alone, but extends its benefits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
to the neighboring fields. * * The forest, presenting a considerable
surface for evaporation, gives to its own soil and to
all the adjacent ground an abundant and enlivening dew.
There falls, it is true, less dew on a tall and thick wood than
on the surrounding meadows, which, being more highly
heated during the day by the influence of insolation, cool with
greater rapidity by radiation. But it must be remarked, that
this increased deposition of dew on the neighboring fields is
partly due to the forests themselves; for the dense, saturated
strata of air which hover over the woods descend in cool, calm
evenings, like clouds, to the valley, and in the morning, beads
of dew sparkle on the leaves of the grass and the flowers of the
field. Forests, in a word, exert, in the interior of continents,
an influence like that of the sea on the climate of islands and
of coasts: both water the soil and thereby insure its fertility."
In a note upon this passage, quoting as authority the <i>Historia
de la Conquista de las siete islas de Gran Canaria, de Juan de
Abreu Galindo</i>, 1632, p. 47, he adds: "Old historians relate
that a celebrated laurel in Ferro formerly furnished drinkable
water to the inhabitants of the island. The water flowed from
its foliage, uninterruptedly, drop by drop, and was collected in
cisterns. Every morning the sea breeze drove a cloud toward
the wonderful tree, which attracted it to its huge top," where
it was condensed to a liquid form.</p>

<p>In a number of the <i>Missionary Herald</i>, published at Boston,
the date of which I have mislaid, the Rev. Mr. Van
Lennep, well known as a competent observer, gives the following
remarkable account of a similar fact witnessed by him
in an excursion to the east of Tocat in Asia Minor:</p>

<p>"In this region, some 3,000 feet above the sea, the trees
are mostly oak, and attain a large size. I noticed an illustration
of the influence of trees in general in collecting moisture.
Despite the fog, of a week's duration, the ground was everywhere
perfectly dry. The dry oak leaves, however, had gathered
the water, and the branches and trunks of the trees were
more or less wet. In many cases the water had run down the
trunk and moistened the soil around the roots of the tree. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
two places, several trees had each furnished a small stream of
water, and these, uniting, had run upon the road, so that travellers
had to pass through the mud; although, as I said, everywhere
else the ground was perfectly dry. Moreover, the collected
moisture was not sufficient to drop directly from the
leaves, but in every case it ran down the branches and trunk
to the ground. Farther on we found a grove, and at the foot
of each tree, on the north side, was a lump of ice, the water
having frozen as it reached the ground. This is a most striking
illustration of the acknowledged influence of trees in collecting
moisture; and one cannot for a moment doubt, that
the parched regions which commence at Sivas, and extend in
one direction to the Persian Gulf, and in another to the Red
Sea, were once a fertile garden, teeming with a prosperous
population, before the forests which covered the hillsides were
cut down&mdash;before the cedar and the fir tree were rooted up
from the sides of Lebanon.</p>

<p>"As we now descended the northern side of the watershed,
we passed through the grove of walnut, oak, and black mulberry
trees, which shade the village of Oktab, whose houses,
cattle, and ruddy children were indicative of prosperity."</p>

<p>Coultas thus argues: "The ocean, winds, and woods may
be regarded as the several parts of a grand distillatory apparatus.
The sea is the boiler in which vapor is raised by the
solar heat, the winds are the guiding tubes which carry the
vapor with them to the forests where a lower temperature prevails.
This naturally condenses the vapor, and showers of rain
are thus distilled from the cloud masses which float in the
atmosphere, by the woods beneath them."<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>Sir John F. W. Herschel enumerates among "the influences
unfavorable to rain," "absence of vegetation in warm climates,
and especially of trees. This is, no doubt," continues he, "one
of the reasons of the extreme aridity of Spain. The hatred of
a Spaniard toward a tree is proverbial. Many districts in
France have been materially injured by denudation (Earl of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Lovelace on Climate, etc.), and, on the other hand, rain has
become more frequent in Egypt since the more vigorous cultivation
of the palm tree."</p>

<p>Hohenstein remarks: "With respect to the temperature in
the forest, I have already observed that, at certain times of
the day and of the year, it is less than in the open field.
Hence the woods may, in the daytime, in summer and toward
the end of winter, tend to increase the fall of rain; but it
is otherwise in summer nights and at the beginning of winter,
when there is a higher temperature in the forest, which is not
favorable to that effect. * * * The wood is, further, like
the mountain, a mechanical obstruction to the motion of rain
clouds, and, as it checks them in their course, it gives them
occasion to deposit their water. These considerations render
it probable that the forest increases the quantity of rain; but
they do not establish the certainty of this conclusion, because
we have no positive numerical data to produce on the depression
of temperature, and the humidity of the air in the
woods."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Barth presents the following view of the subject: "The
ground in the forest, as well as the atmospheric stratum over
it, continues humid after the woodless districts have lost their
moisture; and the air, charged with the humidity drawn from
them, is usually carried away by the winds before it has deposited
itself in a condensed form on the earth. Trees constantly
transpire through their leaves a great quantity of moisture,
which they partly absorb again by the same organs, while
the greatest part of their supply is pumped up through their
widely ramifying roots from considerable depths in the ground.
Thus a constant evaporation is produced, which keeps the
forest atmosphere moist even in long droughts, when all other
sources of humidity in the forest itself are dried up. * * *
Little is required to compel the stratum of air resting upon a
wood to give up its moisture, which thus, as rain, fog, or dew,
is returned to the forest. * * * The warm, moist currents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
of air which come from other regions are cooled as they approach
the wood by its less heated atmosphere, and obliged to
let fall the humidity with which they are charged. The woods
contribute to the same effect by mechanically impeding the
motion of fog and rain cloud, whose particles are thus accumulated
and condensed to rain. The forest thus has a greater
power than the open ground to retain within its own limits
already existing humidity, and to preserve it, and it attracts
and collects that which the wind brings it from elsewhere, and
forces it to deposit itself as rain or other precipitation. * * *
In consequence of these relations of the forest to humidity, it
follows that wooded districts have both more frequent and
more abundant rain, and in general are more humid, than
woodless regions; for what is true of the woods themselves, in
this respect, is true also of their treeless neighborhood, which,
in consequence of the ready mobility of the air and its constant
changes, receives a share of the characteristics of the forest
atmosphere, coolness and moisture. * * * When the districts
stripped of trees have long been deprived of rain and
dew, * * * and the grass and the fruits of the field are
ready to wither, the grounds which are surrounded by woods
are green and flourishing. By night they are refreshed with
dew, which is never wanting in the moist air of the forest, and
in due season they are watered by a beneficent shower, or a
mist which rolls slowly over them."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>Asbj&ouml;rnsen, after adducing the familiar theoretical arguments
on this point, adds: "The rainless territories in Peru
and North Africa establish this conclusion, and numerous
other examples show that woods exert an influence in producing
rain, and that rain fails where they are wanting; for
many countries have, by the destruction of the forests, been
deprived of rain, moisture, springs, and watercourses, which
are necessary for vegetable growth. * * * The narratives
of travellers show the deplorable consequences of felling
the woods in the Island of Trinidad, Martinique, San Do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>mingo,
and indeed, in almost the entire West Indian group.
* * * In Palestine and many other parts of Asia and
Northern Africa, which in ancient times were the granaries
of Europe, fertile and populous, similar consequences have
been experienced. These lands are now deserts, and it is
the destruction of the forests alone which has produced this
desolation. * * * In Southern France, many districts have,
from the same cause, become barren wastes of stone, and the
cultivation of the vine and the olive has suffered severely since
the baring of the neighboring mountains. Since the extensive
clearings between the Spree and the Oder, the inhabitants
complain that the clover crop is much less productive than
before. On the other hand, examples of the beneficial influence
of planting and restoring the woods are not wanting. In
Scotland, where many miles square have been planted with
trees, this effect has been manifest, and similar observations
have been made in several places in Southern France. In
Lower Egypt, both at Cairo and near Alexandria, rain rarely
fell in considerable quantity&mdash;for example, during the French
occupation of Egypt, about 1798, it did not rain for sixteen
months&mdash;but since Mehemet Aali and Ibrahim Pacha executed
their vast plantations (the former alone having planted more
than twenty millions of olive and fig trees, cottonwood,
oranges, acacias, planes, &amp;c.), there now falls a good deal of
rain, especially along the coast, in the months of November,
December, and January; and even at Cairo it rains both
oftener and more abundantly, so that real showers are no
rarity."<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>Babinet, in one of his lectures,<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> cites the supposed fact of
the increase of rain in Egypt in consequence of the planting
of trees, and thus remarks upon it: "A few years ago it
never rained in Lower Egypt. The constant north winds,
which almost exclusively prevail there, passed without obstruction
over a surface bare of vegetation. Grain was kept on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the roofs in Alexandria, without being covered or otherwise
protected from injury by the atmosphere; but since the making
of plantations, an obstacle has been created which retards
the current of air from the north. The air thus checked, accumulates,
dilates, cools, and yields rain.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The forests of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Vosges and Ardennes produce the same effects in the north
east of France, and send us a great river, the Meuse, which is
as remarkable for its volume as for the small extent of its
basin. With respect to the retardation of the atmospheric
currents, and the effects of that retardation, one of my illustrious
colleagues, M. Mignet, who is not less a profound
thinker than an eloquent writer, suggested to me that, to produce
rain, a forest was as good as a mountain, and this is
literally true."</p>

<p>Monestier-Savignat arrives at this conclusion: "Forests on
the one hand diminish evaporation; on the other, they act on
the atmosphere as refrigerating causes. The second scale of
the balance predominates over the other, for it is established
that in wooded countries it rains oftener, and that, the quantity
of rain being equal, they are more humid."<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>Boussingault&mdash;whose observations on the drying up of
lakes and springs, from the destruction of the woods, in tropical
America, have often been cited as a conclusive proof that
the quantity of rain was thereby diminished&mdash;after examining
the question with much care, remarks: "In my judgment it
is settled that very large clearings must diminish the annual
fall of rain in a country;" and on a subsequent page, he concludes
that, "arguing from meteorological facts collected in
the equinoctial regions, there is reason to presume that clearings
diminish the annual fall of rain."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>The same eminent author proposes series of observations on
the level of natural lakes, especially on those without outlet,
as a means of determining the increase or diminution of precipitation
in their basins, and, of course, of measuring the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
effect of clearing when such operations take place within those
basins. But it must be observed that lakes without a visible
outlet are of very rare occurrence, and besides, where no
superficial conduit for the discharge of lacustrine waters exists,
we can seldom or never be sure that nature has not provided
subterranean channels for their escape. Indeed, when we
consider that most earths, and even some rocks under great
hydrostatic pressure, are freely permeable by water, and that
fissures are frequent in almost all rocky strata, it is evident
that we cannot know in what proportion the depression of the
level of a lake is to be ascribed to infiltration, to percolation,
or to evaporation.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Further, we are, in general, as little able
to affirm that a given lake derives all its water from the fall
of rain within its geographical basin, or that it receives all the
water that falls in that basin except what evaporates from the
ground, as we are to show that all its superfluous water is
carried off by visible channels and by evaporation.</p>

<p>Suppose the strata of the mountains on two sides of a lake,
east and west, to be tilted in the same direction, and that those
of the hill on the east side incline toward the lake, those of
that on the west side from it. In this case a large proportion
of the rain which falls on the eastern slope of the eastern hill
may find its way between the strata to the lake, and an equally
large proportion of the precipitation upon the eastern slope of
the western ridge may escape out of the basin by similar channels.
In such case the clearing of the <i>outer</i> slopes of either
or both mountains, while the forests of the <i>inner</i> declivities
remained intact, might affect the quantity of water received by
the lake, and it would always be impossible to know to what
territorial extent influences thus affecting the level of a lake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
might reach. Boussingault admits that extensive clearing
<i>below</i> an alpine lake, even at a considerable distance, might
affect the level of its waters. How it would produce this
influence he does not inform us, but, as he says nothing of the
natural subterranean drainage of surface waters, it is to be
presumed that he refers to the supposed diminution of the
quantity of rain from the removal of the forest, which might
manifest itself at a point more elevated than the cause which
occasioned it. The elevation or depression of the level of natural
lakes, then, cannot be relied upon as a proof, still less as a
measure of an increase or diminution in the fall of rain within
their geographical basins, resulting from the felling of the
woods which covered them; though such phenomena afford
very strong presumptive evidence that the supply of water is
somehow augmented or lessened. The supply is, in most
cases, derived much less from the precipitation which falls
directly upon the surface of lakes, than from waters which
flow above or under the ground around them, and which, in
the latter case, often come from districts not comprised within
what superficial geography would regard as belonging to the
lake basins.</p>

<p>It is, upon the whole, evident that the question can hardly
be determined except by the comparison of pluviometrical
observations made at a given station before and after the destruction
of the woods. Such observations, unhappily, are
scarcely to be found, and the opportunity for making them is
rapidly passing away, except so far as a converse series might
be collected in countries&mdash;France, for example&mdash;where forest
plantation is now going on upon a large scale. The Smithsonian
Institution at Washington is well situated for directing
the attention of observers in the newer territory of the United
States to this subject, and it is to be hoped that it will not fail
to avail itself of its facilities for this purpose.</p>

<p>Numerous other authorities might be cited in support of
the proposition that forests tend, at least in certain latitudes
and at certain seasons, to produce rain; but though the arguments
of the advocates of this doctrine are very plausible, not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
to say convincing, their opinions are rather <i>&agrave; priori</i> conclusions
from general meteorological laws, than deductions from facts
of observation, and it is remarkable that there is so little direct
evidence on the subject.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Foissac expresses the opinion that
forests have no influence on precipitation, beyond that of promoting
the deposit of dew in their vicinity, and he states, as a
fact of experience, that the planting of large vegetables, and
especially of trees, is a very efficient means of drying morasses,
because the plants draw from the earth a quantity of water
larger than the average annual fall of rain.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Kl&ouml;den, admitting
that the rivers Oder and Elbe have diminished in quantity
of water, the former since 1778, the latter since 1828,
denies that the diminution of volume is to be ascribed to a
decrease of precipitation in consequence of the felling of the
forests, and states, what other physicists confirm, that, during
the same period, meteorological records in various parts of
Europe show rather an augmentation than a reduction of
rain.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>The observations of Belgrand tend to show, contrary to the
general opinion, that less rain falls in wooded than in denuded
districts. He compared the precipitation for the year 1852, at
Vezelay in the valley of the Bouchat, and at Avallon in the
valley of the Greneti&egrave;re. At the first of these places it was
881 millim&egrave;tres, at the latter 581 millim&egrave;tres. The two cities
are not more than eight miles apart. They are at the same
altitude, and it is stated that the only difference in their geographical
conditions consists in the different proportions of
forest and cultivated country around them, the basin of the
Bouchat being entirely bare, while that of the Greneti&egrave;re is
well wooded.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Observations in the same valleys, considered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
with reference to the seasons, show the following pluviometric
results:</p>

<p>These observations, so far as they go, seem to show that
more rain falls in cleared than in wooded countries, but this
result is so contrary to what has been generally accepted as a
theoretical conclusion, that further experiment is required to
determine the question.</p>

<p>Becquerel&mdash;whose treatise on the climatic effects of the
destruction of the forest is the fullest general discussion of that
subject known to me&mdash;does not examine this particular point,
and as, in the summary of the results of his investigations, he
does not ascribe to the forest any influence upon precipitation,
the presumption is that he rejects the doctrine of its importance
as an agent in producing the fall of rain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect of the forest on precipitation, then, is not entirely
free from doubt, and we cannot positively affirm that the total
annual quantity of rain is diminished or increased by the destruction
of the woods, though both theoretical considerations
and the balance of testimony strongly favor the opinion that
more rain falls in wooded than in open countries. One important
conclusion, at least, upon the meteorological influence
of forests is certain and undisputed: the proposition, namely,
that, within their own limits, and near their own borders,
they maintain a more uniform degree of humidity in the
atmosphere than is observed in cleared grounds. Scarcely
less can it be questioned that they promote the frequency of
showers, and, if they do not augment the amount of precipitation,
they equalize its distribution through the different
seasons.</p>


<h4><i>Influence of the Forest on the Humidity of the Soil.</i></h4>

<p>I have hitherto confined myself to the influence of the
forest on meteorological conditions, a subject, as has been seen,
full of difficulty and uncertainty. Its comparative effects on
the temperature, the humidity, the texture and consistence,
the configuration and distribution of the mould or arable soil,
and, very often, of the mineral strata below, and on the permanence
and regularity of springs and greater superficial
watercourses, are much less disputable as well as more easily estimated,
and much more important, than its possible value as a
cause of strictly climatic equilibrium or disturbance.</p>

<p>The action of the forest on the earth is chiefly mechanical,
but the organic process of abstraction of water by its roots
affects the quantity of that fluid contained in the vegetable
mould, and in the mineral strata near the surface, and, consequently,
the consistency of the soil. In treating of the effects
of trees on the moisture of the atmosphere, I have said that the
forest, by interposing a canopy between the sky and the
ground, and by covering the surface with a thick mantle of
fallen leaves, at once obstructed insolation and prevented the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
radiation of heat from the earth. These influences go far to
balance each other; but familiar observation shows that, in
summer, the forest soil is not raised to so high a temperature
as open grounds exposed to irradiation. For this reason, and
in consequence of the mechanical resistance opposed by the
bed of dead leaves to the escape of moisture, we should expect
that, except after recent rains, the superficial strata of woodland
soil would be more humid than that of cleared land.
This agrees with experience. The soil of the forest is always
moist, except in the extremest droughts, and it is exceedingly
rare that a primitive wood suffers from want of humidity.
How far this accumulation of water affects the condition of
neighboring grounds by lateral infiltration, we do not know,
but we shall see, in a subsequent chapter, that water is conveyed
to great distances by this process, and we may hence
infer that the influence in question is an important one.</p>


<h4><i>Influence of the Forest on the Flow of Springs.</i></h4>

<p>It is well established that the protection afforded by the
forest against the escape of moisture from its soil, insures the
permanence and regularity of natural springs, not only within
the limits of the wood, but at some distance beyond its borders,
and thus contributes to the supply of an element essential
to both vegetable and animal life. As the forests are
destroyed, the springs which flowed from the woods, and, consequently,
the greater watercourses fed by them, diminish
both in number and in volume. This fact is so familiar
throughout the American States and the British Provinces,
that there are few old residents of the interior of those districts
who are not able to testify to its truth as a matter of personal
observation. My own recollection suggests to me many instances
of this sort, and I remember one case where a small
mountain spring, which disappeared soon after the clearing of
the ground where it rose, was recovered about ten or twelve
years ago, by simply allowing the bushes and young trees to
grow up on a rocky knoll, not more than half an acre in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
extent, immediately above it, and has since continued to flow
uninterruptedly. The uplands in the Atlantic States formerly
abounded in sources and rills, but in many parts of those
States which have been cleared for above a generation or two,
the hill pastures now suffer severely from drought, and in dry
seasons no longer afford either water or herbage for cattle.</p>

<p>Foissac, indeed, quotes from the elder Pliny (<i>Nat. Hist.</i>,
xxxi, c. 30) a passage affirming that the felling of the woods
gives rise to springs which did not exist before because the
water of the soil was absorbed by the trees; and the same
meteorologist declares, as I observed in treating of the effect
of the forest on atmospheric humidity, that the planting of
trees tends to drain marshy ground, because the roots absorb
more water than falls from the air. But Pliny's statement
rests on very doubtful authority, and Foissac cites no evidence
in support of his own proposition.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> In the American States,
it is always observed that clearing the ground not only causes
running springs to disappear, but dries up the stagnant pools
and the spongy soils of the low grounds. The first roads in
those States ran along the ridges, when practicable, because
there only was the earth dry enough to allow of their construction,
and, for the same reason, the cabins of the first settlers
were perched upon the hills. As the forests have been from
time to time removed, and the face of the earth laid open to
the air and sun, the moisture has been evaporated, and the
removal of the highways and of human habitations from the
bleak hills to the sheltered valleys, is one of the most agree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>able
among the many improvements which later generations
have witnessed in the interior of New England and the other
Northern States.</p>

<p>Almost every treatise on the economy of the forest adduces
numerous facts in support of the doctrine that the clearing of
the woods tends to diminish the flow of springs and the humidity
of the soil, and it might seem unnecessary to bring
forward further evidence on this point.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> But the subject is of
too much practical importance and of too great philosophical
interest to be summarily disposed of; and it ought particularly
to be noticed that there is at least one case&mdash;that of some
loose soils which, when bared of wood, very rapidly absorb
and transmit to lower strata the water they receive from the
atmosphere, as argued by Vall&egrave;s<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>&mdash;where the removal of the
forest may increase the flow of springs at levels below it, by
exposing to the rain and melted snow a surface more bibulous,
and at the same time less retentive, than its original covering.
Under such circumstances, the water of precipitation, which
had formerly flowed off without penetrating through the superficial
layers of leaves upon the ground&mdash;as, in very heavy
showers, it sometimes does&mdash;or been absorbed by the vegetable
mould and retained until it was evaporated, might descend
through porous earth until it meets an impermeable stratum,
and then be conducted along it, until, finally, at the outcrop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>ping
of this stratum, it bursts from a hillside as a running
spring. But such instances are doubtless too rare to form a
frequent or an important exception to the general law, because
it is only under very uncommon circumstances that rain water
runs off over the surface of forest ground instead of sinking
into it, and very rarely the case that such a soil as has just
been supposed is covered by a layer of vegetable earth thick
enough to retain, until it is evaporated, all the rain that falls
upon it, without imparting any water to the strata below it.</p>

<p>If we look at the point under discussion as purely a question
of fact, to be determined by positive evidence and not by
argument, the observations of Boussingault are, both in the
circumstances they detail, and in the weight of authority to
be attached to the testimony, among the most important yet
recorded. They are embodied in the fourth section of the
twentieth chapter of that writer's <i>&Eacute;conomie Rurale</i>, and I have
already referred to them on page 191 for another purpose.
The interest of the question will justify me in giving, in Boussingault's
own words, the facts and some of the remarks with
which he accompanies the details of them: "In many localities,"
he observes,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> "it has been thought that, within a certain
number of years, a sensible diminution has been perceived in
the volume of water of streams utilized as a motive power;
at other points, there are grounds for believing that rivers
have become shallower, and the increasing breadth of the belt
of pebbles along their banks seems to prove the loss of a part
of their water; and, finally, abundant springs have almost
dried up. These observations have been principally made in
valleys bounded by high mountains, and it is thought to have
been noticed that this diminution of the waters has immediately
followed the epoch when the inhabitants have begun
to destroy, unsparingly, the woods which were spread over the
face of the land.</p>

<p>"These facts would indicate that, where clearings have
been made, it rains less than formerly, and this is the gener<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>ally
received opinion. * * * But while the facts I have
stated have been established, it has been observed, at the same
time, that, since the clearing of the mountains, the rivers and
the torrents, which seemed to have lost a part of their water,
sometimes suddenly swell, and that, occasionally, to a degree
which causes great disasters. Besides, after violent storms,
springs which had become almost exhausted have been observed
to burst out with impetuosity, and soon after to dry up
again. These latter observations, it will be easily conceived,
warn us not to admit hastily the common opinion that the
felling of the woods lessens the quantity of rain; for not only
is it very possible that the quantity of rain has not changed,
but the mean volume of running water may have remained
the same, in spite of the appearance of drought presented by
the rivers and springs, at certain periods of the year. Perhaps
the only difference would be that the flow of the same quantity
of water becomes more irregular in consequence of clearing.
For instance: if the low water of the Rhone during one part
of the year were exactly compensated by a sufficient number
of floods, it would follow that this river would convey to the
Mediterranean the same volume of water which it carried to
that sea in ancient times, before the period when the countries
near its source were stripped of their woods, and when, probably,
its mean depth was not subject to so great variations as
in our days. If this were so, the forests would have this value&mdash;that
of regulating, of economizing in a certain sort, the
drainage of the rain water.</p>

<p>"If running streams really become rarer in proportion as
clearing is extended, it follows either that the rain is less abundant,
or that evaporation is greatly favored by a surface which
is no longer protected by trees against the rays of the sun and
the wind. These two causes, acting in the same direction,
must often be cumulative in their effects, and before we attempt
to fix the value of each, it is proper to inquire whether
it is an established fact that running waters diminish on the
surface of a country in which extensive clearing is going on;
in a word, to examine whether an apparent fact has not been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
mistaken for a real one. And here lies the practical point of
the question; for if it is once established that clearing diminishes
the volume of streams, it is less important to know to what
special cause this effect is due. * * * I shall attach no
value except to facts which have taken place under the eye of
man, as it is the influence of his labors on the meteorological
condition of the atmosphere which I propose to estimate.
What I am about to detail has been observed particularly in
America, but I shall endeavor to establish, that what I believe
to be true of America would be equally so for any other continent.</p>

<p>"One of the most interesting parts of Venezuela is, no
doubt, the valley of Aragua. Situated at a short distance from
the coast, and endowed, from its elevation, with various climates
and a soil of unexampled fertility, its agriculture embraces
at once the crops suited to tropical regions and to
Europe. Wheat succeeds well on the heights of Victoria.
Bounded on the north by the coast chain, on the south by a
system of mountains connected with the Llanos, the valley is
shut in on the east and the west by lines of hills which completely
close it. In consequence of this singular configuration,
the rivers which rise within it, having no outlet to the ocean,
form, by their union, the beautiful Lake of Tacarigua or Valencia.
This lake, according to Humboldt, is larger than that of
Neufch&acirc;tel; it is at an elevation of 439 m&egrave;tres [= 1,460
English feet] above the sea, and its greatest length does not
exceed two leagues and a half [= seven English miles].</p>

<p>"At the time of Humboldt's visit to the valley of Aragua,
the inhabitants were struck by the gradual diminution which
the lake had been undergoing for thirty years. In fact, by
comparing the descriptions given by historians with its actual
condition, even making large allowance for exaggeration, it
was easy to see that the level was considerably depressed.
The facts spoke for themselves. Oviedo, who, toward the
close of the sixteenth century, had often traversed the valley
of Aragua, says positively that New Valencia was founded, in
1555, at half a league from the Lake of Tacarigua; in 1800,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Humboldt found this city 5,260 m&egrave;tres [= 3&#8531; English miles]
from the shore.</p>

<p>"The aspect of the soil furnished new proofs. Many hillocks
on the plain retain the name of islands, which they more
justly bore when they were surrounded by water. The ground
laid bare by the retreat of the lake was converted into admirable
plantations of cotton, bananas, and sugar cane; and buildings
erected near the lake showed the sinking of the water
from year to year. In 1796, new islands made their appearance.
An important military point, a fortress built in 1740 on
the island of Cabrera, was now on a peninsula; and, finally,
on two granitic islands, those of Cura and Cabo Blanco, Humboldt
observed among the shrubs, some m&egrave;tres above the
water, fine sand filled with helicites.</p>

<p>"These clear and positive facts suggested numerous explanations,
all assuming a subterranean outlet, which permitted
the discharge of the water to the ocean. Humboldt disposed
of these hypotheses, and, after a careful examination of the
locality, the distinguished traveller did not hesitate to ascribe
the diminution of the waters of the lake to the numerous clearings
which had been made in the valley of Aragua within half
a century. * * *</p>

<p>"In 1800, the valley of Aragua possessed a population as
dense as that of any of the best-peopled parts of France.
* * * Such was the prosperous condition of this fine country
when Humboldt occupied the Hacienda de Cura.</p>

<p>"Twenty-two years later, I explored the valley of Aragua,
fixing my residence in the little town of Maracay. For some
years previous, the inhabitants had observed that the waters
of the lake were no longer retiring, but, on the contrary, were
sensibly rising. Grounds, not long before occupied by plantations,
were submerged. The islands of Nuevas Aparecidas,
which appeared above the surface in 1796, had again become
shoals dangerous to navigation. Cabrera, a tongue of land on
the north side of the valley, was so narrow that the least rise
of the water completely inundated it. A protracted north
wind sufficed to flood the road between Maracay and New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Valencia. The fears which the inhabitants of the shores had
so long entertained were reversed. * * * Those who had
explained the diminution of the lake by the supposition of subterranean
channels were suspected of blocking them up, to
prove themselves in the right.</p>

<p>"During the twenty-two years which had elapsed, important
political events had occurred. Venezuela no longer belonged
to Spain. The peaceful valley of Aragua had been the
theatre of bloody struggles, and a war of extermination had
desolated these smiling lands and decimated their population.
At the first cry of independence a great number of slaves
found their liberty by enlisting under the banners of the new
republic; the great plantations were abandoned, and the forest,
which in the tropics so rapidly encroaches, had soon recovered
a large proportion of the soil which man had wrested from
it by more than a century of constant and painful labor.</p>

<p>"At the time of the growing prosperity of the valley of
Aragua, the principal affluents of the lake were diverted, to
serve for irrigation, and the rivers were dry for more than six
months of the year. At the period of my visit, their waters,
no longer employed, flowed freely."</p>

<p>Boussingault proceeds to state that two lakes near Ubate
in New Granada, at an elevation of 2,562 m&egrave;tres (= 8,500
English feet), where there is a constant temperature of 14&deg; to
16&deg; centigrade [= 57&deg;, 61&deg; Fahrenheit], had formed but one,
a century before his visit; that the waters were gradually
retiring, and the plantations extending over the abandoned
bed; that, by inquiry of old hunters and by examination of
parish records, he found that extensive clearings had been
made and were still going on.</p>

<p>He found, also, that the length of the Lake of Fuquen&eacute;, in
the same valley, had, within two centuries, been reduced from
ten leagues to one and a half, its breadth from three leagues to
one. At the former period, timber was abundant, and the
neighboring mountains were covered, to a certain height, with
American oaks, laurels, and other trees of indigenous species;
but at the time of his visit the mountains had been almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
entirely stripped of their wood, chiefly to furnish fuel for salt-works.
Our author adds that other cases, similar to those
already detailed, might be cited, and he proceeds to show, by
several examples, that the waters of other lakes in the same
regions, where the valleys had always been bare of wood, or
where the forests had not been disturbed, had undergone no
change of level.</p>

<p>Boussingault further maintains that the lakes of Switzerland
have sustained a depression of level since the too prevalent
destruction of the woods, and arrives at the general conclusion,
that, "in countries where great clearings have been made,
there has most probably been a diminution in the living waters
which flow upon the surface of the ground." This conclusion
he further supports by two examples: one, where a fine spring,
at the foot of a wooded mountain in the Island of Ascension,
dried up when the mountain was cleared, but reappeared when
the wood was replanted; the other at Marmato, in the province
of Popayan, where the streams employed to drive machinery
were much diminished in volume, within two years after the
clearing of the heights from which they derived their supplies.
This latter is an interesting case, because, although the rain
gauges, established as soon as the decrease of water began to
excite alarm, showed a greater fall of rain for the second year
of observation than the first, yet there was no appreciable
increase in the flow of the mill streams. From these cases, the
distinguished physicist infers that very restricted local clearings
may diminish and even suppress springs and brooks,
without any reduction in the total quantity of rain.</p>

<p>It will have been noticed that these observations, with the
exception of the last two cases, do not bear directly upon the
question of the diminution of springs by clearings, but they
logically infer it from the subsidence of the natural reservoirs
which springs once filled. There is, however, no want of positive
evidence on this subject.</p>

<p>Marschand cites the following instances: "Before the felling
of the woods, within the last few years, in the valley of the
Soulce, the Combe-&egrave;s-Mounin and the Little Valley, the Sorne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
furnished a regular and sufficient supply of water for the iron
works of Unterwyl, which was almost unaffected by drought
or by heavy rains. The Sorne has now become a torrent,
every shower occasions a flood, and after a few days of fine
weather, the current falls so low that it has been necessary to
change the water wheels, because those of the old construction
are no longer able to drive the machinery, and at last to introduce
a steam engine to prevent the stoppage of the works for
want of water.</p>

<p>"When the factory of St. Ursanne was established, the
river that furnished its power was abundant, long known and
tried, and had, from time immemorial, sufficed for the machinery
of a previous factory. Afterward, the woods near its
sources were cut. The supply of water fell off in consequence,
the factory wanted water for half the year, and was at last
obliged to stop altogether.</p>

<p>"The spring of Combefoulat, in the commune of Seleate,
was well known as one of the best in the country; it was
remarkably abundant and sufficient, in spite of the severest
droughts, to supply all the fountains of the town; but, as soon
as considerable forests were felled in Combe-de-pr&eacute; Martin and
in the valley of Combefoulat, the famous spring which lies
below these woods has become a mere thread of water, and
disappears altogether in times of drought.</p>

<p>"The spring of Varieux, which formerly supplied the castle
of Pruntrut, lost more than half its water after the clearing of
Varieux and Rongeoles. These woods have been replanted,
the young trees are growing well, and with the woods, the
waters of the spring are increasing.</p>

<p>"The Dog Spring between Pruntrut and Bressancourt has
entirely vanished since the surrounding forests grounds were
brought under cultivation.</p>

<p>"The Wolf Spring, in the commune of Soubey, furnishes a
remarkable example of the influence of the woods upon fountains.
A few years ago this spring did not exist. At the
place where it now rises, a small thread of water was observed
after very long rains, but the stream disappeared with the rain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
The spot is in the middle of a very steep pasture inclining to
the south. Eighty years ago, the owner of the land, perceiving
that young firs were shooting up in the upper part of it,
determined to let them grow, and they soon formed a flourishing
grove. As soon as they were well grown, a fine spring
appeared in place of the occasional rill, and furnished abundant
water in the longest droughts. For forty or fifty years,
this spring was considered the best in the Clos du Doubs. A
few years since, the grove was felled, and the ground turned
again to a pasture. The spring disappeared with the wood,
and is now as dry as it was ninety years ago."<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>"The influence of the forest on springs," says Hummel,
"is strikingly shown by an instance at Heilbronn. The woods
on the hills surrounding the town are cut in regular succession
every twentieth year. As the annual cuttings approach a certain
point, the springs yield less water, some of them none at
all; but as the young growth shoots up, they now more and
more freely, and at length bubble up again in all their original
abundance."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>Piper states the following case: "Within about half a mile
of my residence there is a pond upon which mills have been
standing for a long time, dating back, I believe, to the first
settlement of the town. These have been kept in constant
operation until within some twenty or thirty years, when the
supply of water began to fail. The pond owes its existence to
a stream which has its source in the hills which stretch some
miles to the south. Within the time mentioned, these hills,
which were clothed with a dense forest, have been almost
entirely stripped of trees; and to the wonder and loss of the
mill owners, the water in the pond has failed, except in the
season of freshets; and, what was never heard of before, the
stream itself has been entirely dry. Within the last ten years
a new growth of wood has sprung up on most of the land
formerly occupied by the old forest; and now the water runs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
through the year, notwithstanding the great droughts of the
last few years, going back from 1856."</p>

<p>Dr. Piper quotes from a letter of William C. Bryant the
following remarks: "It is a common observation that our
summers are become drier, and our streams smaller. Take
the Cuyahoga as an illustration. Fifty years ago large barges
loaded with goods went up and down that river, and one of
the vessels engaged in the battle of Lake Erie, in which the
gallant Perry was victorious, was built at Old Portage, six
miles north of Albion, and floated down to the lake. Now, in
an ordinary stage of the water, a canoe or skiff can hardly pass
down the stream. Many a boat of fifty tons burden has been
built and loaded in the Tuscarawas, at New Portage, and
sailed to New Orleans without breaking bulk. Now, the river
hardly affords a supply of water at New Portage for the canal.
The same may be said of other streams&mdash;they are drying up.
And from the same cause&mdash;the destruction of our forests&mdash;our
summers are growing drier, and our winters colder."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>No observer has more carefully studied the influence of the
forest upon the flow of the waters, or reasoned more ably on
the ascertained phenomena than Cantegril. The facts presented
in the following case, communicated by him to the
<i>Ami des Sciences</i> for December, 1859, are as nearly conclusive
as any single instance well can be:</p>

<p>"In the territory of the commune of Labrugui&egrave;re, there is
a forest of 1,834 hectares [4,530 acres], known by the name of
the Forest of Montaut, and belonging to that commune. It
extends along the northern slope of the Black Mountains.
The soil is granitic, the maximum altitude 1,243 m&egrave;tres [4,140
feet], and the inclination ranges between 15 and 60 to 100.</p>

<p>"A small current of water, the brook of Caunan, takes its
rise in this forest, and receives the waters of two thirds of its
surface. At the lower extremity of the wood and on the
stream are several fulleries, each requiring a force of eight
horse-power to drive the water wheels which work the stamp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>ers.
The commune of Labrugui&egrave;re had been for a long time
famous for its opposition to forest laws. Trespasses and abuses
of the right of pasturage had converted the wood into an
immense waste, so that this vast property now scarcely sufficed
to pay the expense of protecting it, and to furnish the inhabitants
with a meagre supply of fuel. While the forest was
thus ruined, and the soil thus bared, the water, after every
abundant rain, made an eruption into the valley, brought
down a great quantity of pebbles which still clog the current
of the Caunan. The violence of the floods was sometimes such
that they were obliged to stop the machinery for some time.
During the summer another inconvenience was felt. If the
dry weather continued a little longer than usual, the delivery
of water became insignificant. Each fullery could for the
most part only employ a single set of stampers, and it was not
unusual to see the work entirely suspended.</p>

<p>"After 1840, the municipal authority succeeded in enlightening
the population as to their true interests. Protected
by a more watchful supervision, aided by well-managed replantation,
the forest has continued to improve to the present
day. In proportion to the restoration of the forest, the condition
of the manufactories has become less and less precarious,
and the action of the water is completely modified. For
example, there are, no longer, sudden and violent floods which
make it necessary to stop the machinery. There is no increase
in the delivery until six or eight hours after the beginning of
the rain; the floods follow a regular progression till they reach
their maximum, and decrease in the same manner. Finally,
the fulleries are no longer forced to suspend work in summer;
the water is always sufficiently abundant to allow the employment
of two sets of stampers at least, and often even of three.</p>

<p>"This example is remarkable in this respect, that, all other
circumstances having remained the same, the changes in the
action of the stream can be attributed only to the restoration
of the forest&mdash;changes which may be thus summed up: diminution
of flood water during rains&mdash;increase of delivery at other
seasons."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>The Forest in Winter.</i></h4>

<p>To estimate rightly the importance of the forest as a natural
apparatus for accumulating the water that falls upon the
surface and transmitting it to the subjacent strata, we must
compare the condition and properties of its soil with those of
cleared and cultivated earth, and examine the consequently
different action of these soils at different seasons of the year.
The disparity between them is greatest in climates where, as
in the Northern American States and in the North of Europe,
the open ground freezes and remains impervious to water
during a considerable part of the winter; though, even in
climates where the earth does not freeze at all, the woods have
still an important influence of the same character. The difference
is yet greater in countries which have regular wet and
dry seasons, rain being very frequent in the former period,
while, in the latter, it scarcely occurs at all. These countries
lie chiefly in or near the tropics, but they are not wanting in
higher latitudes; for a large part of Asiatic and even of
European Turkey is almost wholly deprived of summer rains.
In the principal regions occupied by European cultivation,
and where alone the questions discussed in this volume are
recognized as having, at present, any practical importance,
rain falls at all seasons, and it is to these regions that, on this
point as well as others, I chiefly confine my attention.</p>

<p>The influence of the forest upon the waters of the earth
has been more studied in France than in any other part of the
civilized world, because that country has, in recent times, suffered
most severely from the destruction of the woods. But
in the southern provinces of that empire, where the evils
resulting from this cause are most sensibly felt, the winters are
not attended with much frost, while, in Northern Europe,
where the winters are rigorous enough to freeze the ground to
the depth of some inches, or even feet, a humid atmosphere
and frequent summer rains prevent the drying up of the
springs observed in southern latitudes when the woods are
gone. For these reasons, the specific character of the forest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
as a winter reservoir of moisture in countries with a cold and
dry atmosphere, has not attracted so much attention in France
and Northern Europe as it deserves in the United States,
where an excessive climate renders that function of the woods
more important.</p>

<p>In New England, irregular as the climate is, the first
autumnal snows usually fall before the ground is frozen at all,
or when the frost extends at most to the depth of only a few
inches. In the woods, especially those situated upon the
elevated ridges which supply the natural irrigation of the soil
and feed the perennial fountains and streams, the ground
remains covered with snow during the winter; for the trees
protect the snow from blowing from the general surface into
the depressions, and new accessions are received before the
covering deposited by the first fall is melted. Snow is of a
color unfavorable for radiation, but, even when it is of considerable
thickness, it is not wholly impervious to the rays of the
sun, and for this reason, as well as from the warmth of lower
strata, the frozen crust, if one has been formed, is soon thawed,
and does not again fall below the freezing point during the
winter.</p>

<p>The snow in contact with the earth now begins to melt,
with greater or less rapidity, according to the relative temperature
of the earth and the air, while the water resulting from
its dissolution is imbibed by the vegetable mould, and carried
off by infiltration so fast that both the snow and the layers of
leaves in contact with it often seem comparatively dry, when,
in fact, the under surface of the former is in a state of perpetual
thaw. No doubt a certain proportion of the snow is
returned to the atmosphere by direct evaporation, but in the
woods it is partially protected from the action of the sun, and
as very little water runs off in the winter by superficial watercourses,
except in rare cases of sudden thaw, there can be no
question that much the greater part of the snow deposited in
the forest is slowly melted and absorbed by the earth.</p>

<p>The quantity of snow that falls in extensive forests, far
from the open country, has seldom been ascertained by direct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
observation, because there are few meteorological stations in
such situations. In the Northeastern border States of the
American Union, the ground in the deep woods is covered
with snow four or five months, and the proportion of water
which falls in snow does not exceed one fifth of the total precipitation
for the year.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Although, in the open grounds, snow
and ice are evaporated with great rapidity in clear weather,
even when the thermometer stands far below the freezing
point, the surface of the snow in the woods does not indicate
much loss in this way. Very small deposits of snowflakes
remain unevaporated in the forest, for many days after snow
let fall at the same time in the cleared field has disappeared
without either a thaw to melt it or a wind powerful enough to
drift it away. Even when bared of their leaves, the trees of a
wood obstruct, in an important degree, both the direct action
of the sun's rays on the snow, and the movement of drying
and thawing winds.</p>

<p>Dr. Piper records the following observations: "A body of
snow, one foot in depth, and sixteen feet square, was protected
from the wind by a tight board fence about five feet high,
while another body of snow, much more sheltered from the
sun than the first, six feet in depth, and about sixteen feet
square, was fully exposed to the wind. When the thaw came
on, which lasted about a fortnight, the larger body of snow
was entirely dissolved in less than a week, while the smaller
body was not wholly gone at the end of the second week.</p>

<p>"Equal quantities of snow were placed in vessels of the
same kind and capacity, the temperature of the air being seventy
degrees. In the one case, a constant current of air was
kept passing over the open vessel, while the other was protected
by a cover. The snow in the first was dissolved in
sixteen minutes, while the latter had a small unthawed proportion
remaining at the end of eighty-five minutes."<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>The snow in the woods is protected in the same way,
though not literally to the same extent as by the fence in one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
of these cases and the cover in the other. Little of the winter
precipitation, therefore, is lost by evaporation, and as it slowly
melts at bottom it is absorbed by the earth, and but a very
small quantity of water runs off from the surface. The immense
importance of the forest, as a reservoir of this stock of
moisture, becomes apparent, when we consider that a large
proportion of the summer rain either flows into the valleys
and the rivers, because it falls faster than the ground can
imbibe it; or, if absorbed by the warm superficial strata, is
evaporated from them without sinking deep enough to reach
wells and springs, which, of course, depend very much on
winter rains and snows for their entire supply. This observation,
though specially true of cleared and cultivated grounds,
is not wholly inapplicable to the forest, particularly when, as
is too often the case in Europe, the underwood and the decaying
leaves are removed.</p>

<p>The general effect of the forest in cold climates is to assimilate
the winter state of the ground to that of wooded regions
under softer skies; and it is a circumstance well worth noting,
that in Southern Europe, where nature has denied to the earth
a warm winter-garment of flocculent snow, she has, by one of
those compensations in which her empire is so rich, clothed
the hillsides with umbrella pines, ilexes, cork oaks, and other
trees of persistent foliage, whose evergreen leaves afford to
the soil a protection analogous to that which it derives from
snow in more northern climates.</p>

<p>The water imbibed by the soil in winter sinks until it
meets a more or less impermeable, or a saturated stratum, and
then, by unseen conduits, slowly finds its way to the channels
of springs, or oozes out of the ground in drops which unite in
rills, and so all is conveyed to the larger streams, and by them
finally to the sea. The water, in percolating through the vegetable
and mineral layers, acquires their temperature, and is
chemically affected by their action, but it carries very little
matter in mechanical suspension.</p>

<p>The process I have described is a slow one, and the supply
of moisture derived from the snow, augmented by the rains of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
the following seasons, keeps the forest ground, where the surface
is level or but moderately inclined, in a state of saturation
through almost the whole year. The rivers fed by springs and
shaded by woods are comparatively uniform in volume, in
temperature, and in chemical composition. Their banks are
little abraded, nor are their courses much obstructed by fallen
timber, or by earth and gravel washed down from the highlands.
Their channels are subject only to slow and gradual
changes, and they carry down to the lakes and the sea no
accumulation of sand or silt to fill up their outlets, and, by
raising their beds, to force them to spread over the low
grounds near their mouth.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>In this state of things, destructive tendencies of all sorts
are arrested or compensated, and tree, bird, beast, and fish,
alike, find a constant uniformity of condition most favorable to
the regular and harmonious coexistence of them all.</p>


<h4><i>General Consequences of the Destruction of the Forest.</i></h4>

<p>With the disappearance of the forest, all is changed. At
one season, the earth parts with its warmth by radiation to an
open sky&mdash;receives, at another, an immoderate heat from the
unobstructed rays of the sun. Hence the climate becomes
excessive, and the soil is alternately parched by the fervors of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
summer, and seared by the rigors of winter. Bleak winds
sweep unresisted over its surface, drift away the snow that
sheltered it from the frost, and dry up its scanty moisture.
The precipitation becomes as regular as the temperature; the
melting snows and vernal rains, no longer absorbed by a loose
and bibulous vegetable mould, rush over the frozen surface,
and pour down the valleys seaward, instead of filling a retentive
bed of absorbent earth, and storing up a supply of moisture
to feed perennial springs. The soil is bared of its covering
of leaves, broken and loosened by the plough, deprived of the
fibrous rootlets which held it together, dried and pulverized
by sun and wind, and at last exhausted by new combinations.
The face of the earth is no longer a sponge, but a dust heap,
and the floods which the waters of the sky pour over it hurry
swiftly along its slopes, carrying in suspension vast quantities
of earthy particles which increase the abrading power and
mechanical force of the current, and, augmented by the sand
and gravel of falling banks, fill the beds of the streams, divert
them into new channels and obstruct their outlets. The rivulets,
wanting their former regularity of supply and deprived of
the protecting shade of the woods, are heated, evaporated, and
thus reduced in their summer currents, but swollen to raging
torrents in autumn and in spring. From these causes, there is
a constant degradation of the uplands, and a consequent elevation
of the beds of watercourses and of lakes by the deposition
of the mineral and vegetable matter carried down by the
waters. The channels of great rivers become unnavigable,
their estuaries are choked up, and harbors which once sheltered
large navies are shoaled by dangerous sandbars. The earth,
stripped of its vegetable glebe, grows less and less productive,
and, consequently, less able to protect itself by weaving a new
network of roots to bind its particles together, a new carpeting
of turf to shield it from wind and sun and scouring rain.
Gradually it becomes altogether barren. The washing of the
soil from the mountains leaves bare ridges of sterile rock, and
the rich organic mould which covered them, now swept down
into the dank low grounds, promotes a luxuriance of aquatic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
vegetation that breeds fever, and more insidious forms of mortal
disease, by its decay, and thus the earth is rendered no
longer fit for the habitation of man.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>To the general truth of this sad picture there are many
exceptions, even in countries of excessive climates. Some of
these are due to favorable conditions of surface, of geological
structure, and of the distribution of rain; in many others, the
evil consequences of man's improvidence have not yet been
experienced, only because a sufficient time has not elapsed,
since the felling of the forest, to allow them to develop themselves.
But the vengeance of nature for the violation of her
harmonies, though slow, is sure, and the gradual deterioration
of soil and climate in such exceptional regions is as certain to
result from the destruction of the woods as is any natural effect
to follow its cause.</p>

<p>In the vast farrago of crudities which the elder Pliny's ambition
of encyclop&aelig;dic attainment and his ready credulity have
gathered together, we meet some judicious observations.
Among these we must reckon the remark with which he
accompanies his extraordinary statement respecting the prevention
of springs by the growth of forest trees, though, as is
usual with him, his philosophy is wrong. "Destructive torrents
are generally formed when hills are stripped of the trees
which formerly confined and absorbed the rains." The absorption
here referred to is not that of the soil, but of the roots,
which, Pliny supposed, drank up the water to feed the growth
of the trees.</p>

<p>Although this particular evil effect of too extensive clearing
was so early noticed, the lesson seems to have been soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
forgotten. The legislation of the Middle Ages in Europe is
full of absurd provisions concerning the forests, which sovereigns
sometimes destroyed because they furnished a retreat for
rebels and robbers, sometimes protected because they were
necessary to breed stags and boars for the chase, and sometimes
spared with the more enlightened view of securing a
supply of timber and of fuel to future generations.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> It was
reserved to later ages to appreciate their geographical importance,
and it is only in very recent times, only in a few European
countries, that the too general felling of the woods has
been recognized as the most destructive among the many
causes of the physical deterioration of the earth.</p>


<h4><i>Condition of the Forest, and its Literature in different
Countries.</i></h4>

<p>The literature of the forest, which in England and America
has not yet become sufficiently extensive to be known as a
special branch of authorship, counts its thousands of volumes
in Germany, Italy, and France. It is in the latter country,
perhaps, that the relations of the woods to the regular drainage
of the soil, and especially to the permanence of the natural
configuration of terrestrial surface, have been most thoroughly
investigated. On the other hand, the purely economical aspects
of sylviculture have been most satisfactorily expounded,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
and that art has been most philosophically discussed, and most
skilfully and successfully practised, in Germany.</p>

<p>The eminence of Italian theoretical hydrographers and the
great ability of Italian hydraulic engineers are well known,
but the specific geographical importance of the woods has not
been so clearly recognized in Italy as in the states bordering
it on the north and west. It is true that the face of nature has
been as completely revolutionized by man, and that the action
of torrents has created as wide and as hopeless devastation in
that country as in France; but in the French Empire the desolation
produced by clearing the forests is more recent,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> has
been more suddenly effected, and, therefore, excites a livelier
and more general interest than in Italy, where public opinion
does not so readily connect the effect with its true cause.
Italy, too, from ancient habit, employs little wood in architectural
construction; for generations she has maintained no military
or commercial marine large enough to require exhaustive
quantities of timber,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> and the mildness of her climate makes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
small demands on the woods for fuel. Besides these circumstances,
it must be remembered that the sciences of observation
did not become knowledges of practical application till
after the mischief was already mainly done and even forgotten
in Alpine Italy, while its evils were just beginning to be
sensibly felt in France when the claims of natural philosophy
as a liberal study were first acknowledged in modern Europe.
The former political condition of the Italian Peninsula would
have effectually prevented the adoption of a general system of
forest economy, however clearly the importance of a wise administration
of this great public interest might have been
understood. The woods which controlled and regulated the
flow of the river sources were very often in one jurisdiction,
the plains to be irrigated, or to be inundated by floods and
desolated by torrents, in another. Concert of action on such a
subject between a multitude of jealous petty sovereignties was
obviously impossible, and nothing but the union of all the
Italian states under a single government can render practicable
the establishment of such arrangements for the conservation
and restoration of the forests and the regulation of the
flow of the waters as are necessary for the full development of
the yet unexhausted resources of that fairest of lands, and
even for the permanent maintenance of the present condition
of its physical geography.</p>

<p>The denudation of the Central and Southern Apennines
and of the Italian declivity of the Western Alps began at a
period of unknown antiquity, but it does not seem to have
been carried to a very dangerous length until the foreign con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>quests
and extended commerce of Rome created a greatly
increased demand for wood for the construction of ships and
for military material. The Eastern Alps, the Western Apennines,
and the Maritime Alps retained their forests much later;
but even here the want of wood, and the injury to the plains
and the navigation of the rivers by sediment brought down by
the torrents, led to some legislation for the protection of the
forests, by the Republic of Venice in the fifteenth century, by
that of Genoa as early at least as the seventeenth; and Marschand
states that the latter Government passed laws requiring
the proprietors of mountain lands to replant the woods. These,
however, do not seem to have been effectually enforced. It is
very common in Italy to ascribe to the French occupation
under the first Empire all the improvements, and all the abuses
of recent times, according to the political sympathies of the
individual; and the French are often said to have prostrated
every forest which has disappeared within a century.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> But,
however this may be, no energetic system of repression or
restoration was adopted by any of the Italian states after the
downfall of the Empire, and the taxes on forest property in
some of them were so burdensome that rural municipalities
sometimes proposed to cede their common woods to the Government,
without any other compensation than the remission
of the taxes imposed on forest lands.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Under such circumstances,
woodlands would soon become disafforested, and where
facilities of transportation and a good demand for timber have
increased the inducements to fell it, as upon the borders of the
Mediterranean, the destruction of the forest and all the evils
which attend it have gone on at a seriously alarming rate. It
has even been calculated that four tenths of the area of the
Ligurian provinces have been washed away or rendered incapable
of cultivation by the felling of the woods.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>The damp and cold climate of England requires the maintenance
of household fires through a large part of the year.
Contrivances for economizing fuel were of later introduction
in that country than on the Continent. The soil, like the sky,
was, in general, charged with humidity; its natural condition
was unfavorable for common roads, and the transportation of
so heavy a material as coal, by land, from the remote counties
where alone it was mined in the Middle Ages, was costly and
difficult. For all these reasons, the consumption of wood was
large, and apprehensions of the exhaustion of the forests were
excited at an early period. Legislation there, as elsewhere,
proved ineffectual to protect them, and many authors of the
sixteenth century express fears of serious evils from the wasteful
economy of the people in this respect. Harrison, in his
curious chapter "Of Woods and Marishes" in Holinshed's
compilation, complains of the rapid decrease of the forests, and
adds: "Howbeit thus much I dare affirme, that if woods go
so fast to decaie in the next hundred yeere of Grace, as they
haue doone and are like to doo in this, * * * it is to
be feared that the fennie bote, broome, turfe, gall, heath, firze,
brakes, whinnes, ling, dies, hassacks, flags, straw, sedge, r&eacute;ed,
rush, and also <i>seacole</i>, will be good merchandize euen in the
citie of London, whereunto some of them euen now haue gotten
readie passage, and taken vp their innes in the greatest merchants'
parlours. * * * I would wish that I might liue no
longer than to s&eacute;e foure things in this land reformed, that is:
the want of discipline in the church: the couetous dealing of
most of our merchants in the preferment of the commodities
of other countries, and hinderance of their owne: the holding
of faires and markets vpon the sundaie to be abolished and
referred to the wednesdaies: and that euerie man, in whatsoeuer
part of the champaine soile enioieth fortie acres of land,
and vpwards, after that rate, either by fr&eacute;e deed, copie hold,
or fee farme, might plant one acre of wood, or sowe the same
with oke mast, hasell, b&eacute;ech, and sufficient prouision be made
that it may be cherished and kept. But I feare me that I
should then liue too long, and so long, that I should either be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
wearie of the world, or the world of me."<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Evelyn's "Silva,"
the first edition of which appeared in 1664, rendered an extremely
important service to the cause of the woods, and there
is no doubt that the ornamental plantations in which England
far surpasses all other countries, are, in some measure, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
fruit of Evelyn's enthusiasm. In England, however, arboriculture,
the planting and nursing of single trees, has, until
recently, been better understood than sylviculture, the sowing
and training of the forest. But this latter branch of rural
improvement is now pursued on a very considerable scale,
though, so far as I know, not by the National Government.</p>


<h4><i>The Influence of the Forest on Inundations.</i></h4>

<p>Besides the climatic question, which I have already sufficiently
discussed, and the obvious inconveniences of a scanty
supply of charcoal, of fuel, and of timber for architectural and
naval construction and for the thousand other uses to which
wood is applied in rural and domestic economy, and in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
various industrial processes of civilized life, the attention of
French foresters and public economists has been specially
drawn to three points, namely: the influence of the forests on
the permanence and regular flow of springs or natural fountains;
on inundations by the overflow of rivers; and on the
abrasion of soil and the transportation of earth, gravel, pebbles,
and even of considerable masses of rock, from higher to lower
levels, by torrents. There are, however, connected with this
general subject, several other topics of minor or strictly local
interest, or of more uncertain character, which I shall have
occasion more fully to speak of hereafter.</p>

<p>The first of these three principal subjects&mdash;the influence
of the woods on springs and other living waters&mdash;has been
already considered; and if the facts stated in that discussion
are well established, and the conclusions I have drawn from
them are logically sound, it would seem to follow, as a necessary
corollary, that the action of the forest is as important in
diminishing the frequency and violence of river floods, as in
securing the permanence and equability of natural fountains;
for any cause which promotes the absorption and accumulation
of the water of precipitation by the superficial strata of
the soil, to be slowly given out by infiltration and percolation,
must, by preventing the rapid flow of surface water into the
natural channels of drainage, tend to check the sudden rise of
rivers, and, consequently, the overflow of their banks, which
constitutes what is called inundation. The mechanical resistance,
too, offered by the trunks of trees and of undergrowth
to the flow of water over the surface, tends sensibly to retard
the rapidity of its descent down declivities, and to divert and
divide streams which may have already accumulated from
smaller threads of water.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>Inundations are produced by the insufficiency of the natural
channels of rivers to carry off the waters of their basins as
fast as those waters flow into them. In accordance with the
usual economy of nature, we should presume that she had
everywhere provided the means of discharging, without disturbance
of her general arrangements or abnormal destruction
of her products, the precipitation which she sheds upon the
face of the earth. Observation confirms this presumption, at
least in the countries to which I confine my inquiries; for, so
far as we know the primitive conditions of the regions brought
under human occupation within the historical period, it appears
that the overflow of river banks was much less frequent
and destructive than at the present day, or, at least, that rivers
rose and fell less suddenly before man had removed the natural
checks to the too rapid drainage of the basins in which their
tributaries originate. The banks of the rivers and smaller
streams in the North American colonies were formerly little
abraded by the currents. Even now the trees come down
almost to the water's edge along the rivers, in the larger forests
of the United States, and the surface of the streams seems
liable to no great change in level or in rapidity of current. A
circumstance almost conclusive as to the regularity of flow in
forest rivers, is that they do not form large sedimentary deposits,
at their points of discharge into lakes or larger streams,
such accumulations beginning, or at least advancing far more
rapidly, after the valleys are cleared.</p>

<p>In the Northern United States, although inundations are
sometimes produced in the height of summer by heavy rains,
it will be found generally true that the most rapid rise of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
waters, and, of course, the most destructive "freshets," as they
are called in America, are produced by the sudden dissolution
of the snow before the open ground is thawed in the spring.
It frequently happens that a powerful thaw sets in after a long
period of frost, and the snow which had been months in accumulating
is dissolved and carried off in a few hours. When
the snow is deep, it, to use a popular expression, "takes the
frost out of the ground" in the woods, and, if it lies long
enough, in the fields also. But the heaviest snows usually fall
after midwinter, and are succeeded by warm rains or sunshine,
which dissolve the snow on the cleared land before it has had
time to act upon the frost-bound soil beneath it. In this case,
the snow in the woods is absorbed as fast as it melts, by the
soil it has protected from freezing, and does not materially contribute
to swell the current of the rivers. If the mild weather,
in which great snowstorms usually occur, does not continue
and become a regular thaw, it is almost sure to be followed by
drifting winds, and the inequality with which they distribute
the snow leaves the ridges comparatively bare, while the depressions
are often filled with drifts to the height of many feet.
The knolls become frozen to a great depth; succeeding partial
thaws melt the surface snow, and the water runs down into the
furrows of ploughed fields, and other artificial and natural hollows,
and then often freezes to solid ice. In this state of things,
almost the entire surface of the cleared land is impervious to
water, and from the absence of trees and the general smoothness
of the ground, it offers little mechanical resistance to
superficial currents. If, under these circumstances, warm
weather accompanied by rain occurs, the rain and melted
snow are swiftly hurried to the bottom of the valleys and
gathered to raging torrents.</p>

<p>It ought further to be considered that, though the lighter
ploughed soils readily imbibe a great deal of water, yet the
grass lands, and all the heavy and tenacious earths, absorb it
in much smaller quantities, and less rapidly than the vegetable
mould of the forest. Pasture, meadow, and clayey soils, taken
together, greatly predominate over the sandy ploughed fields,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
in all large agricultural districts, and hence, even if, in the
case we are supposing, the open ground chance to have been
thawed before the melting of the snow which covers it, it is
already saturated with moisture, or very soon becomes so, and,
of course, cannot relieve the pressure by absorbing more water.
The consequence is that the face of the country is suddenly
flooded with a quantity of melted snow and rain equivalent to
a fall of six or eight inches of the latter, or even more. This
runs unobstructed to rivers often still bound with thick ice,
and thus inundations of a fearfully devastating character are
produced. The ice bursts, from the hydrostatic pressure from
below, or is violently torn up by the current, and is swept by
the impetuous stream, in large masses and with resistless fury,
against banks, bridges, dams, and mills erected near them.
The bark of the trees along the rivers is often abraded, at a
height of many feet above the ordinary water level, by cakes
of floating ice, which are at last stranded by the receding flood
on meadow or ploughland, to delay, by their chilling influence,
the advent of the tardy spring.</p>

<p>The surface of a forest, in its natural condition, can never
pour forth such deluges of water as flow from cultivated soil.
Humus, or vegetable mould, is capable of absorbing almost
twice its own weight of water. The soil in a forest of deciduous
foliage is composed of humus, more or less unmixed, to
the depth of several inches, sometimes even of feet, and this
stratum is usually able to imbibe all the water possibly resulting
from the snow which at any one time covers it. But the
vegetable mould does not cease to absorb water when it becomes
saturated, for it then gives off a portion of its moisture
to the mineral earth below, and thus is ready to receive a new
supply; and, besides, the bed of leaves not yet converted to
mould takes up and retains a very considerable proportion of
snow water, as well as of rain.</p>

<p>In the warm climates of Southern Europe, as I have
already said, the functions of the forest, so far as the disposal
of the water of precipitation is concerned, are essentially the
same at all seasons, and are analogous to those which it per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>forms
in the Northern United States in summer. Hence, in
the former countries, the winter floods have not the characteristics
which mark them in the latter, nor is the conservative
influence of the woods in winter relatively so important,
though it is equally unquestionable.</p>

<p>If the summer floods in the United States are attended
with less pecuniary damage than those of the Loire and other
rivers of France, the Po and its tributaries in Italy, the Emme
and her sister torrents which devastate the valleys of Switzerland,
it is partly because the banks of American rivers are not
yet lined with towns, their shores and the bottoms which skirt
them not yet covered with improvements whose cost is counted
by millions, and, consequently, a smaller amount of property
is exposed to injury by inundation. But the comparative
exemption of the American people from the terrible calamities
which the overflow of rivers has brought on some of the fairest
portions of the Old World, is, in a still greater degree, to be
ascribed to the fact that, with all our thoughtless improvidence,
we have not yet bared all the sources of our streams, not yet
overthrown all the barriers which nature has erected to restrain
her own destructive energies. Let us be wise in time, and
profit by the errors of our older brethren!</p>

<p>The influence of the forest in preventing inundations has
been very generally recognized, both as a theoretical inference
and as a fact of observation; but Belgrand and his commentator
Vall&egrave;s have deduced an opposite result from various facts
of experience and from scientific considerations. They contend
that the superficial drainage is more regular from cleared
than from wooded ground, and that clearing diminishes rather
than augments the intensity of inundations. Neither of these
conclusions is warranted by their data or their reasoning, and
they rest partly upon facts, which, truly interpreted, are not
inconsistent with the received opinions on these subjects,
partly upon assumptions which are contradicted by experience.
Two of these latter are, first, that the fallen leaves in the forest
constitute an impermeable covering of the soil over, not
through, which the water of rains and of melting snows flows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
off, and secondly, that the roots of trees penetrate and choke
up the fissures in the rocks, so as to impede the passage of
water through channels which nature has provided for its
descent to lower strata.</p>

<p>As to the first of these, we may appeal to familiar facts
within the personal knowledge of every man acquainted with
the operations of sylvan nature. I have before me a letter
from an acute and experienced observer, containing this paragraph:
"I think that rain water does not ever, except in very
trifling quantities, flow over the leaves in the woods in summer
or autumn. Water runs over them only in the spring,
when they are pressed down smoothly and compactly, a state
in which they remain only until they are dry, when shrinkage
and the action of the wind soon roughen the surface so as
effectually to stop, by absorption, all flow of water." I have
observed that when a sudden frost succeeds a thaw at the close
of the winter after the snow has principally disappeared, the
water in and between the layers of leaves sometimes freezes
into a solid crust, which allows the flow of water over it. But
this occurs only in depressions and on a very small scale; and
the ice thus formed is so soon dissolved that no sensible effect
is produced on the escape of water from the general surface.</p>

<p>As to the influence of roots upon drainage, I believe there
is no doubt that they, independently of their action as absorbents,
mechanically promote it. Not only does the water of
the soil follow them downward,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> but their swelling growth
powerfully tends to enlarge the crevices of rock into which
they enter; and as the fissures in rocks are longitudinal, not
mere circular orifices, every line of additional width gained by
the growth of roots within them increases the area of the crev<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>ice
in proportion to its length. Consequently, the widening
of a fissure to the extent of one inch might give an additional
drainage equal to a square foot of open tubing.</p>

<p>The observations and reasonings of Belgrand and Vall&egrave;s,
though their conclusions have not been accepted by many, are
very important in one point of view. These writers insist
much on the necessity of taking into account, in estimating
the relations between precipitation and evaporation, the abstraction
of water from the surface and surface currents, by
absorption and infiltration&mdash;an element unquestionably of
great value, but hitherto much neglected by meteorological
inquirers, who have very often reasoned as if the surface earth
were either impermeable to water, or already saturated with
it; whereas, in fact, it is a sponge, always imbibing humidity
and always giving it off, not by evaporation only, but by infiltration
and percolation.</p>

<p>The destructive effects of inundations considered simply as
a mechanical power by which life is endangered, crops destroyed,
and the artificial constructions of man overthrown,
are very terrible. Thus far, however, the flood is a temporary
and by no means an irreparable evil, for if its ravages end here,
the prolific powers of nature and the industry of man soon
restore what had been lost, and the face of the earth no longer
shows traces of the deluge that had overwhelmed it. Inundations
have even their compensations. The structures they
destroy are replaced by better and more secure erections, and
if they sweep off a crop of corn, they not unfrequently leave
behind them, as they subside, a fertilizing deposit which enriches
the exhausted field for a succession of seasons.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> If,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
then, the too rapid flow of the surface waters occasioned no
other evil than to produce, once in ten years upon the average,
an inundation which should destroy the harvest of the low
grounds along the rivers, the damage would be too inconsiderable,
and of too transitory a character, to warrant the inconveniences
and the expense involved in the measures which the
most competent judges in many parts of Europe believe the
respective governments ought to take to obviate it.</p>


<h4><i>Destructive Action of Torrents.</i></h4>

<p>But the great, the irreparable, the appalling mischiefs
which have already resulted, and threaten to ensue on a still
more extensive scale hereafter, from too rapid superficial drainage,
are of a properly geographical character, and consist
primarily in erosion, displacement, and transportation of the
superficial strata, vegetable and mineral&mdash;of the integuments,
so to speak, with which nature has clothed the skeleton framework
of the globe. It is difficult to convey by description an
idea of the desolation of the regions most exposed to the ravages
of torrent and of flood; and the thousands, who, in these
days of travel, are whirled by steam near or even through the
theatres of these calamities, have but rare and imperfect opportunities
of observing the destructive causes in action. Still
more rarely can they compare the past with the actual condition
of the provinces in question, and trace the progress of
their conversion from forest-crowned hills, luxuriant pasture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
grounds, and abundant cornfields and vineyards well watered
by springs and fertilizing rivulets, to bald mountain ridges,
rocky declivities, and steep earth banks furrowed by deep
ravines with beds now dry, now filled by torrents of fluid
mud and gravel hurrying down to spread themselves over the
plain, and dooming to everlasting barrenness the once productive
fields. In traversing such scenes, it is difficult to resist
the impression that nature pronounced the curse of perpetual
sterility and desolation upon these sublime but fearful wastes,
difficult to believe that they were once, and but for the folly
of man might still be, blessed with all the natural advantages
which Providence has bestowed upon the most favored climes.
But the historical evidence is conclusive as to the destructive
changes occasioned by the agency of man upon the flanks of
the Alps, the Apennines, the Pyrenees, and other mountain
ranges in Central and Southern Europe, and the progress of
physical deterioration has been so rapid that, in some localities,
a single generation has witnessed the beginning and the
end of the melancholy revolution.</p>

<p>It is certain that a desolation, like that which has overwhelmed
many once beautiful and fertile regions of Europe,
awaits an important part of the territory of the United States,
and of other comparatively new countries over which European
civilization is now extending its sway, unless prompt measures
are taken to check the action of destructive causes already in
operation. It is vain to expect that legislation can do anything
effectual to arrest the progress of the evil in those countries,
except so far as the state is still the proprietor of extensive
forests. Woodlands which have passed into private hands
will everywhere be managed, in spite of legal restrictions, upon
the same economical principles as other possessions, and every
proprietor will, as a general rule, fell his woods, unless he
believes that it will be for his pecuniary interest to preserve
them. Few of the new provinces which the last three centuries
have brought under the control of the European race,
would tolerate any interference by the law-making power with
what they regard as the most sacred of civil rights&mdash;the right,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
namely, of every man to do what he will with his own. In the
Old World, even in France, whose people, of all European
nations, love best to be governed and are least annoyed by
bureaucratic supervision, law has been found impotent to prevent
the destruction, or wasteful economy, of private forests;
and in many of the mountainous departments of that country,
man is at this moment so fast laying waste the face of the
earth, that the most serious fears are entertained, not only of
the depopulation of those districts, but of enormous mischiefs
to the provinces contiguous to them.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> The only legal provisions
from which anything is to be hoped, are such as shall
make it a matter of private advantage to the landholder to
spare the trees upon his grounds, and promote the growth of
the young wood. Something may be done by exempting
standing forests from taxation, and by imposing taxes on wood
felled for fuel or for timber, something by premiums or honorary
distinctions for judicious management of the woods. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
would be difficult to induce governments, general or local, to
make the necessary appropriations for such purposes, but there
can be no doubt that it would be sound economy in the end.</p>

<p>In countries where there exist municipalities endowed with
an intelligent public spirit, the purchase and control of forests
by such corporations would often prove advantageous; and in
some of the provinces of Northern Lombardy, experience has
shown that such operations may be conducted with great benefit
to all the interests connected with the proper management
of the woods. In Switzerland, on the other hand, except in
some few cases where woods have been preserved as a defence
against avalanches, the forests of the communes have been
productive of little advantage to the public interests, and have
very generally gone to decay. The rights of pasturage, everywhere
destructive to trees, combined with toleration of trespasses,
have so reduced their value, that there is, too often,
nothing left that is worth protecting. In the canton of Ticino,
the peasants have very frequently voted to sell the town woods
and divide the proceeds among the corporators. The sometimes
considerable sums thus received are squandered in wild
revelry, and the sacrifice of the forests brings not even a momentary
benefit to the proprietors.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>It is evidently a matter of the utmost importance that the
public, and especially land owners, be roused to a sense of the
dangers to which the indiscriminate clearing of the woods may
expose not only future generations, but the very soil itself.
Fortunately, some of the American States, as well as the governments
of many European colonies, still retain the ownership
of great tracts of primitive woodland. The State of New
York, for example, has, in its northeastern counties, a vast
extent of territory in which the lumberman has only here and
there established his camp, and where the forest, though interspersed
with permanent settlements, robbed of some of its
finest pine groves, and often ravaged by devastating fires, still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
covers far the largest proportion of the surface. Through this
territory, the soil is generally poor, and even the new clearings
have little of the luxuriance of harvest which distinguishes
them elsewhere. The value of the land for agricultural uses
is therefore very small, and few purchases are made for any
other purpose than to strip the soil of its timber. It has been
often proposed that the State should declare the remaining
forest the inalienable property of the commonwealth, but I
believe the motive of the suggestion has originated rather in
poetical than in economical views of the subject. Both these
classes of considerations have a real worth. It is desirable that
some large and easily accessible region of American soil should
remain, as far as possible, in its primitive condition, at once a
museum for the instruction of the student, a garden for the
recreation of the lover of nature, and an asylum where indigenous
tree, and humble plant that loves the shade, and fish
and fowl and four-footed beast, may dwell and perpetuate their
kind, in the enjoyment of such imperfect protection as the
laws of a people jealous of restraint can afford them. The
immediate loss to the public treasury from the adoption of this
policy would be inconsiderable, for these lands are sold at low
rates. The forest alone, economically managed, would, without
injury, and even with benefit to its permanence and growth,
soon yield a regular income larger than the present value of
the fee.</p>

<p>The collateral advantages of the preservation of these forests
would be far greater. Nature threw up those mountains
and clothed them with lofty woods, that they might serve as a
reservoir to supply with perennial waters the thousand rivers
and rills that are fed by the rains and snows of the Adirondacks,
and as a screen for the fertile plains of the central counties
against the chilling blasts of the north wind, which meet
no other barrier in their sweep from the Arctic pole. The
climate of Northern New York even now presents greater
extremes of temperature than that of Southern France. The
long continued cold of winter is far more intense, the short
heats of summer not less fierce than in Provence, and hence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the preservation of every influence that tends to maintain an
equilibrium of temperature and humidity is of cardinal importance.
The felling of the Adirondack woods would ultimately
involve for Northern and Central New York consequences
similar to those which have resulted from the laying
bare of the southern and western declivities of the French
Alps and the spurs, ridges, and detached peaks in front of
them.</p>

<p>It is true that the evils to be apprehended from the clearing
of the mountains of New York may be less in degree than
those which a similar cause has produced in Southern France,
where the intensity of its action has been increased by the
inclination of the mountain declivities, and by the peculiar
geological constitution of the earth. The degradation of the
soil is, perhaps, not equally promoted by a combination of the
same circumstances, in any of the American Atlantic States,
but still they have rapid slopes and loose and friable soils
enough to render widespread desolation certain, if the further
destruction of the woods is not soon arrested. The effects of
clearing are already perceptible in the comparatively unviolated
region of which I am speaking. The rivers which rise
in it flow with diminished currents in dry seasons, and with
augmented volumes of water after heavy rains. They bring
down much larger quantities of sediment, and the increasing
obstructions to the navigation of the Hudson, which are extending
themselves down the channel in proportion as the
fields are encroaching upon the forest, give good grounds for
the fear of serious injury to the commerce of the important
towns on the upper waters of that river, unless measures are
taken to prevent the expansion of "improvements" which
have already been carried beyond the demands of a wise
economy.</p>

<p>I have stated, in a general way, the nature of the evils in
question, and of the processes by which they are produced;
but I shall make their precise character and magnitude better
understood by presenting some descriptive and statistical details
of facts of actual occurrence. I select for this purpose the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
southeastern portion of France, not because that territory has
suffered more severely than some others, but because its deterioration
is comparatively recent, and has been watched and
described by very competent and trustworthy observers, whose
reports are more easily accessible than those published in other
countries.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>The provinces of Dauphiny, Avignon, and Provence comprise
a territory of fourteen or fifteen thousand square miles,
bounded northwest by the Isere, northeast and east by the
Alps, south by the Mediterranean, west by the Rhone, and
extending from 42&deg; to about 45&deg; of north latitude. The surface
is generally hilly and even mountainous, and several of
the peaks in Dauphiny rise above the limit of perpetual snow.
The climate, as compared with that of the United States in the
same latitude, is extremely mild. Little snow falls, except
upon the higher mountain ranges, the frosts are light, and the
summers long, as might, indeed, be inferred from the vegetation;
for in the cultivated districts, the vine and the fig everywhere
flourish, the olive thrives as far north as 43&frac12;&deg;, and upon
the coast, grow the orange, the lemon, and the date palm. The
forest trees, too, are of southern type, umbrella pines, various
species of evergreen oaks, and many other trees and shrubs of
persistent broad-leaved foliage, characterizing the landscape.</p>

<p>The rapid slope of the mountains naturally exposed these
provinces to damage by torrents, and the Romans diminished
their injurious effects by erecting, in the beds of ravines, barriers
of rocks loosely piled up, which permitted a slow escape
of the water, but compelled it to deposit above the dikes the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
earth and gravel with which it was charged.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> At a later
period the Crusaders brought home from Palestine, with much
other knowledge gathered from the wiser Moslems, the art of
securing the hillsides and making them productive by terracing
and irrigation. The forests which covered the mountains
secured an abundant flow of springs, and the process of
clearing the soil went on so slowly that, for centuries, neither
the want of timber and fuel, nor the other evils about to be
depicted, were seriously felt. Indeed, throughout the Middle
Ages, these provinces were well wooded, and famous for the
fertility and abundance, not only of the low grounds, but of
the hills.</p>

<p>Such was the state of things at the close of the fifteenth
century. The statistics of the seventeenth show that while
there had been an increase of prosperity and population in
Lower Provence, as well as in the correspondingly situated
parts of the other two provinces I have mentioned, there was
an alarming decrease both in the wealth and in the population
of Upper Provence and Dauphiny, although, by the clearing
of the forests, a great extent of plough land and pasturage had
been added to the soil before reduced to cultivation. It was
found, in fact, that the augmented violence of the torrents had
swept away, or buried in sand and gravel, more land than had
been reclaimed by clearing; and the taxes computed by fires
or habitations underwent several successive reductions in con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>sequence
of the gradual abandonment of the wasted soil by its
starving occupants. The growth of the large towns on and
near the Rhone and the coast, their advance in commerce and
industry, and the consequently enlarged demand for agricultural
products, ought naturally to have increased the rural
population and the value of their lands; but the physical
decay of the uplands was such that considerable tracts were
deserted altogether, and in Upper Provence, the fires which in
1471 counted 897, were reduced to 747 in 1699, to 728 in
1733, and to 635 in 1776.</p>

<p>These facts I take from the <i>La Provence au point de vue
des Bois, des Torrents et des Inondations</i>, of Charles de Ribbe,
one of the highest authorities, and I add further details from
the same source.</p>

<p>"Commune of Barles, 1707: Two hills have become connected
by land slides, and have formed a lake which covers
the best part of the soil. 1746: New slides buried twenty
houses composing a village, no trace of which is left; more
than one third of the land had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Monans, 1724: Deserted by its inhabitants and no longer
cultivated.</p>

<p>"Gueydan, 1760: It appears by records that the best
grounds have been swept off since 1756, and that ravines
occupy their place.</p>

<p>"Digne, 1762: The river Bl&eacute;one has destroyed the most
valuable part of the territory.</p>

<p>"Malmaison, 1768: The inhabitants have emigrated, all
their fields having been lost."</p>

<p>In the case of the commune of St. Laurent du Var, it
appears that, after clearings in the Alps, succeeded by others
in the common woods of the town, the floods of the torrent
Var became more formidable, and had already carried off
much land as early as 1708. "The clearing continued, and
more soil was swept away in 1761. In 1762, after another
destructive inundation, many of the inhabitants emigrated,
and in 1765, one half of the territory had been laid waste.</p>

<p>"In 1766, the assessor Serraire said to the Assembly: 'As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
to the damage caused by brooks and torrents, it is impossible
to deny its extent. Upper Provence is in danger of total destruction,
and the waters which lay it waste threaten also the
ruin of the most valuable grounds on the plain below. Villages
have been almost submerged by torrents which formerly
had not even names, and large towns are on the point of
destruction from the same cause.'"</p>

<p>In 1776, Viscount Puget thus reported: "The mere aspect
of Upper Provence is calculated to appal the patriotic magistrate.
One sees only lofty mountains, deep valleys with precipitous
sides, rivers with broad beds and little water, impetuous
torrents, which in floods lay waste the cultivated land
upon their banks and roll huge rocks along their channels;
steep and parched hillsides, the melancholy consequences of
indiscriminate clearing; villages whose inhabitants, finding no
longer the means of subsistence, are emigrating day by day;
houses dilapidated to huts, and but a miserable remnant of
population."</p>

<p>"In a document of the year 1771, the ravages of the torrents
were compared to the effects of an earthquake, half the
soil in many communes seeming to have been swallowed up.</p>

<p>"Our mountains," said the administrators of the province
of the Lower Alps in 1792, "present nothing but a surface of
stony tufa; clearing is still going on, and the little rivulets are
becoming torrents. Many communes have lost their harvests,
their flocks, and their houses by floods. The washing down
of the mountains is to be ascribed to the clearings and the
practice of burning them over."</p>

<p>These complaints, it will be seen, all date before the Revolution,
but the desolation they describe has since advanced
with still swifter steps.</p>

<p>Surell&mdash;whose valuable work, <i>&Eacute;tude sur les Torrents
des Hautes Alpes</i>, published in 1841, presents the most appalling
picture of the desolations of the torrent, and, at the same
time, the most careful studies of the history and essential character
of this great evil&mdash;in speaking of the valley of D&eacute;voluy,
on page 152, says: "Everything concurs to show that it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
anciently wooded. In its peat bogs are found buried trunks
of trees, monuments of its former vegetation. In the framework
of old houses, one sees enormous timber, which is no
longer to be found in the district. Many localities, now completely
bare, still retain the name of 'wood,' and one of them
is called, in old deeds, <i>Comba nigra</i> [Black forest or dell], on
account of its dense woods. These and many other proofs
confirm the local traditions which are unanimous on this
point.</p>

<p>"There, as everywhere in the Upper Alps, the clearings
began on the flanks of the mountains, and were gradually
extended into the valleys and then to the highest accessible
peaks. Then followed the Revolution, and caused the destruction
of the remainder of the trees which had thus far escaped
the woodman's axe."</p>

<p>In a note to this passage, the writer says: "Several persons
have told me that they had lost flocks of sheep, by straying,
in the forests of Mont Auroux, which covered the flanks
of the mountain from La Cluse to Agn&egrave;res. These declivities
are now as bare as the palm of the hand."</p>

<p>The ground upon the steep mountains being once bared of
trees, and the underwood killed by the grazing of horned cattle,
sheep, and goats, every depression becomes a watercourse.
"Every storm," says Surell, page 153, "gives rise to a new
torrent. Examples of such are shown, which, though not yet
three years old, have laid waste the finest fields of their valleys,
and whole villages have narrowly escaped being swept
into ravines formed in the course of a few hours. Sometimes
the flood pours in a sheet over the surface, without ravine or
even bed, and ruins extensive grounds, which are abandoned
forever."</p>

<p>I cannot follow Surell in his description and classification
of torrents, and I must refer the reader to his instructive work
for a full exposition of the theory of the subject. In order,
however, to show what a concentration of destructive energies
may be effected by felling the woods that clothe and support
the sides of mountain abysses, I cite his description of a valley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
descending from the Col Isoard, which he calls "a complete
type of a basin of reception," that is, a gorge which serves as
a common point of accumulation and discharge for the waters
of several lateral torrents. "The aspect of the monstrous
channel," says he, "is frightful. Within a distance of less
than three kilom&egrave;tres [= one mile and seven eighths English],
more than sixty torrents hurl into the depths of the gorge the
debris torn from its two flanks. The smallest of these secondary
torrents, if transferred to a fertile valley, would be
enough to ruin it."</p>

<p>The eminent political economist Blanqui, in a memoir read
before the Academy of Moral and Political Science on the 25th
of November, 1843, thus expresses himself: "Important as
are the causes of impoverishment already described, they are
not to be compared to the consequences which have followed
from the two inveterate evils of the Alpine provinces of
France, the extension of clearing and the ravages of torrents.
* * The most important result of this destruction is this:
that the agricultural capital, or rather the ground itself&mdash;which,
in a rapidly increasing degree, is daily swept away by
the waters&mdash;is totally lost. Signs of unparalleled destitution
are visible in all the mountain zone, and the solitudes of those
districts are assuming an indescribable character of sterility
and desolation. The gradual destruction of the woods has, in
a thousand localities, annihilated at once the springs and the
fuel. Between Grenoble and Brian&ccedil;on in the valley of the
Romanche, many villages are so destitute of wood that they
are reduced to the necessity of baking their bread with sun-dried
cowdung, and even this they can afford to do but once
a year. This bread becomes so hard that it can be cut only
with an axe, and I have myself seen a loaf of bread in September,
at the kneading of which I was present the January
previous.</p>

<p>"Whoever has visited the valley of Barcelonette, those of
Embrun, and of Verdun, and that Arabia Petr&aelig;a of the department
of the Upper Alps, called D&eacute;voluy, knows that there
is no time to lose, that in fifty years from this date France<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
will be separated from Savoy, as Egypt from Syria, by a
desert."<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>It deserves to be specially noticed that the district here
referred to, though now among the most hopelessly waste in
France, was very productive even down to so late a period as
the commencement of the French Revolution. Arthur Young,
writing in 1789, says: "About Barcelonette and in the highest
parts of the mountains, the hill pastures feed a million of
sheep, besides large herds of other cattle;" and he adds:
"With such a soil, and in such a climate we are not to suppose
a country barren because it is mountainous. The valleys
I have visited are, in general, beautiful."<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> He ascribes the
same character to the provinces of Dauphiny, Provence, and
Auvergne, and, though he visited, with the eye of an attentive
and practised observer, many of the scenes since blasted with
the wild desolation described by Blanqui, the Durance and a
part of the course of the Loire are the only streams he mentions
as inflicting serious injury by their floods. The ravages
of the torrents had, indeed, as we have seen, commenced earlier
in some other localities, but we are authorized to infer that
they were, in Young's time, too limited in range, and relatively
too insignificant, to require notice in a general view of
the provinces where they have now ruined so large a proportion
of the soil.</p>

<p>But I resume my citations.</p>

<p>"I do not exaggerate," says Blanqui. "When I shall have
finished my excursion and designated localities by their names,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
there will rise, I am sure, more than one voice from the spots
themselves, to attest the rigorous exactness of this picture of
their wretchedness. I have never seen its equal even in the
Kabyle villages of the province of Constantine; for there you
can travel on horseback, and you find grass in the spring,
whereas in more than fifty communes in the Alps there is
absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>"The clear, brilliant, Alpine sky of Embrun, of Gap, of
Barcelonette, and of Digne, which for months is without a
cloud, produces droughts interrupted only by diluvial rains
like those of the tropics. The abuse of the right of pasturage
and the felling of the woods have stripped the soil of all its
grass and all its trees, and the scorching sun bakes it to the
consistence of porphyry. When moistened by the rain, as it
has neither support nor cohesion, it rolls down to the valleys,
sometimes in floods resembling black, yellow, or reddish lava,
sometimes in streams of pebbles, and even huge blocks of
stone, which pour down with a frightful roar, and in their
swift course exhibit the most convulsive movements. If you
overlook from an eminence one of these landscapes furrowed
with so many ravines, it presents only images of desolation
and of death. Vast deposits of flinty pebbles, many feet in
thickness, which have rolled down and spread far over the
plain, surround large trees, bury even their tops, and rise
above them, leaving to the husbandman no longer a ray of
hope. One can imagine no sadder spectacle than the deep
fissures in the flanks of the mountains, which seem to have
burst forth in eruption to cover the plains with their ruins.
These gorges, under the influence of the sun which cracks and
shivers to fragments the very rocks, and of the rain which
sweeps them down, penetrate deeper and deeper into the heart
of the mountain, while the beds of the torrents issuing from
them are sometimes raised several feet, in a single year, by
the debris, so that they reach the level of the bridges, which,
of course, are then carried off. The torrent beds are recognized
at a great distance, as they issue from the mountains,
and they spread themselves over the low grounds, in fan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>-shaped
expansions, like a mantle of stone, sometimes ten thousand
feet wide, rising high at the centre, and curving toward
the circumference till their lower edges meet the plain.</p>

<p>"Such is their aspect in dry weather. But no tongue can
give an adequate description of their devastations in one of
those sudden floods which resemble, in almost none of their
phenomena, the action of ordinary river water. They are now
no longer overflowing brooks, but real seas, tumbling down in
cataracts, and rolling before them blocks of stone, which are
hurled forward by the shock of the waves like balls shot out by
the explosion of gunpowder. Sometimes ridges of pebbles are
driven down when the transporting torrent does not rise high
enough to show itself, and then the movement is accompanied
with a roar louder than the crash of thunder. A furious wind
precedes the rushing water and announces its approach. Then
comes a violent eruption, followed by a flow of muddy waves,
and after a few hours all returns to the dreary silence which
at periods of rest marks these abodes of desolation.</p>

<p>"This is but an imperfect sketch of this scourge of the
Alps. Its devastations are increasing with the progress of
clearing, and are every day turning a portion of our frontier
departments into barren wastes.</p>

<p>"The unfortunate passion for clearing manifested itself at
the beginning of the French Revolution, and has much increased
under the pressure of immediate want. It has now
reached an extreme point, and must be speedily checked, or
the last inhabitant will be compelled to retreat when the last
tree falls.</p>

<p>"The elements of destruction are increasing in violence.
Rivers might be mentioned whose beds have been raised ten
feet in a single year. The devastation advances in geometrical
progression as the higher slopes are bared of their wood,
and 'the ruin from above,' to use the words of a peasant,
'helps to hasten the desolation below.'</p>

<p>"The Alps of Provence present a terrible aspect. In the
more equable climate of Northern France, one can form no
conception of those parched mountain gorges where not even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
a bush can be found to shelter a bird, where, at most, the
wanderer sees in summer here and there a withered lavender,
where all the springs are dried up, and where a dead silence,
hardly broken by even the hum of an insect, prevails. But if
a storm bursts forth, masses of water suddenly shoot from the
mountain heights into the shattered gulfs, waste without irrigating,
deluge without refreshing the soil they overflow in
their swift descent, and leave it even more seared than it was
from want of moisture. Man at last retires from the fearful
desert, and I have, the present season, found not a living soul
in districts where I remember to have enjoyed hospitality
thirty years ago."</p>

<p>In 1853, ten years after the date of Blanqui's memoir, M.
de Bonville, prefect of the Lower Alps, addressed to the Government
a report in which the following passages occur:</p>

<p>"It is certain that the productive mould of the Alps, swept
off by the increasing violence of that curse of the mountains,
the torrents, is daily diminishing with fearful rapidity. All
our Alps are wholly, or in large proportion, bared of wood.
Their soil, scorched by the sun of Provence, cut up by the
hoofs of the sheep, which, not finding on the surface the grass
they require for their sustenance, scratch the ground in search
of roots to satisfy their hunger, is periodically washed and carried
off by melting snows and summer storms.</p>

<p>"I will not dwell on the effects of the torrents. For sixty
years they have been too often depicted to require to be
further discussed, but it is important to show that their ravages
are daily extending the range of devastation. The bed
of the Durance, which now in some places exceeds 2,000
m&egrave;tres [about 6,600 feet, or a mile and a quarter] in width,
and, at ordinary times, has a current of water less than 10
m&egrave;tres [about 33 feet] wide, shows something of the extent of
the damage.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Where, ten years ago, there were still woods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
and cultivated grounds to be seen, there is now but a vast
torrent: there is not one of our mountains which has not at
least one torrent, and new ones are daily forming.</p>

<p>"An indirect proof of the diminution of the soil is to be
found in the depopulation of the country. In 1852, I reported
to the General Council that, according to the census
of that year, the population of the department of the Lower
Alps had fallen off no less than 5,000 souls in the five years
between 1846 and 1851.</p>

<p>"Unless prompt and energetic measures are taken, it is
easy to fix the epoch when the French Alps will be but a
desert. The interval between 1851 and 1856 will show a
further decrease of population. In 1862, the ministry will
announce a continued and progressive reduction in the number
of acres devoted to agriculture; every year will aggravate
the evil, and, in a half century, France will count more ruins,
and a department the less."</p>

<p>Time has verified the predictions of De Bonville. The later
census returns show a progressive diminution in the population
of the departments of the Lower Alps, the Is&egrave;re, the
Drome, Ari&egrave;ge, the Upper and the Lower Pyrenees, the
Loz&egrave;re, the Ardennes, the Doubs, the Vosges, and, in short, in
all the provinces formerly remarkable for their forests. This
diminution is not to be ascribed to a passion for foreign emigration,
as in Ireland, and in parts of Germany and of Italy;
it is simply a transfer of population from one part of the
empire to another, from soils which human folly has rendered
uninhabitable, by ruthlessly depriving them of their natural
advantages and securities, to provinces where the face of the
earth was so formed by nature as to need no such safeguards,
and where, consequently, she preserves her outlines in spite of
the wasteful improvidence of man.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>Highly colored as these pictures seem, they are not exaggerated,
although the hasty tourist through Southern France
and Northern Italy, finding little in his high road experiences
to justify them, might suppose them so. The lines of communication
by locomotive train and diligence lead generally over
safer ground, and it is only when they ascend the Alpine
passes and traverse the mountain chains, that scenes somewhat
resembling those just described fall under the eye of the ordinary
traveller. But the extension of the sphere of devastation,
by the degradation of the mountains and the transportation
of their debris, is producing analogous effects upon the lower
ridges of the Alps and the plains which skirt them; and even
now one needs but an hour's departure from some great thoroughfares
to reach sites where the genius of destruction revels
as wildly as in the most frightful of the abysses which Blanqui
has painted.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>There is one effect of the action of torrents which few travellers
on the Continent are heedless enough to pass without
notice. I refer to the elevation of the beds of mountain
streams in consequence of the deposit of the debris with which
they are charged. To prevent the spread of sand and gravel
over the fields and the deluging overflow of the raging waters,
the streams are confined by walls and embankments, which are
gradually built higher and higher as the bed of the torrent is
raised, so that, to reach a river, you ascend from the fields
beside it; and sometimes the ordinary level of the stream is
above the streets and even the roofs of the towns through
which it passes.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>The traveller who visits the depths of an Alpine ravine,
observes the length and width of the gorge and the great
height and apparent solidity of the precipitous walls which
bound it, and calculates the mass of rock required to fill the
vacancy, can hardly believe that the humble brooklet which
purls at his feet has been the principal agent in accomplishing
this tremendous erosion. Closer observation will often teach
him, that the seemingly unbroken rock which overhangs the
valley is full of cracks and fissures, and really in such a state
of disintegration that every frost must bring down tons of it.
If he compute the area of the basin which finds here its only
discharge, he will perceive that a sudden thaw of the winter's
deposit of snow, or one of those terrible discharges of rain so
common in the Alps, must send forth a deluge mighty enough
to sweep down the largest masses of gravel and of rock.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
The simple measurement of the cubical contents of the semi-circular
hillock which he climbed before he entered the gorge,
the structure and composition of which conclusively show
that it must have been washed out of this latter by torrential
action, will often account satisfactorily for the disposal of most
of the matter which once filled the ravine.</p>

<p>It must further be remembered, that every inch of the
violent movement of the rocks is accompanied with crushing
concussion, or, at least, with great abrasion, and, as you follow
the deposit along the course of the waters which transport it,
you find the stones gradually rounding off in form, and diminishing
in size until they pass successively into gravel, sand,
impalpable slime.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not mean to assert that all the rocky valleys of the
Alps have been produced by the action of torrents resulting
from the destruction of the forests. All the greater, and many
of the smaller channels, by which that chain is drained, owe
their origin to higher causes. They are primitive fissures,
ascribable to disruption in upheaval or other geological convulsion,
widened and scarped, and often even polished, so to
speak, by the action of glaciers during the ice period, and but
little changed in form by running water in later eras.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>In these valleys of ancient formation, which extend into
the very heart of the mountains, the streams, though rapid,
have lost the true torrential character, if, indeed, they ever
possessed it. Their beds have become approximately constant,
and their walls no longer crumble and fall into the waters that
wash their bases. The torrent-worn ravines, of which I have
spoken, are of later date, and belong more properly to what
may be called the crust of the Alps, consisting of loose rocks,
of gravel, and of earth, strewed along the surface of the great declivities
of the central ridge, and accumulated thickly between
their solid buttresses. But it is on this crust that the mountaineer
dwells. Here are his forests, here his pastures, and the
ravages of the torrent both destroy his world, and convert it
into a source of overwhelming desolation to the plains below.</p>


<h4><i>Transporting Power of Rivers.</i></h4>

<p>An instance that fell under my own observation in 1857,
will serve to show something of the eroding and transporting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
power of streams which, in these respects, fall incalculably
below the torrents of the Alps. In a flood of the Ottaquechee,
a small river which flows through Woodstock, Vermont,
a milldam on that stream burst, and the sediment with which
the pond was filled, estimated after careful measurement at
13,000 cubic yards, was carried down by the current. Between
this dam and the slack water of another, four miles below, the
bed of the stream, which is composed of pebbles interspersed
in a few places with larger stones, is about sixty-five feet wide,
though, at low water, the breadth of the current is considerably
less. The sand and fine gravel were smoothly and evenly distributed
over the bed to a width of fifty-five or sixty feet, and
for a distance of about two miles, except at two or three intervening
rapids, filled up all the interstices between the stones,
covering them to the depth of nine or ten inches, so as to present
a regularly formed concave channel, lined with sand, and
reducing the depth of water, in some places, from five or six
feet to fifteen or eighteen inches. Observing this deposit after
the river had subsided and become so clear that the bottom
could be seen, I supposed that the next flood would produce
an extraordinary erosion of the banks and some permanent
changes in the channel of the stream, in consequence of the
elevation of the bed and the filling up of the spaces between
the stones through which formerly much water had flowed;
but no such result followed. The spring freshet of the next
year entirely washed out the sand its predecessor had deposited,
carried it to ponds and still-water reaches below, and left
the bed of the river almost precisely in its former condition,
though, of course, with the slight displacement of the pebbles
which every flood produces in the channels of such streams.
The pond, though often previously discharged by the breakage
of the dam, had then been undisturbed for about twenty-five
years, and its contents consisted almost entirely of sand, the
rapidity of the current in floods being such that it would let
fall little lighter sediment, even above an obstruction like a
dam. The quantity I have mentioned evidently bears a very
inconsiderable proportion to the total erosion of the stream<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
during that period, because the wash of the banks consists
chiefly of fine earth rather than of sand, and after the pond
was once filled, or nearly so, even this material could no longer
be deposited in it. The fact of the complete removal of the
deposit I have described between the two dams in a single
freshet, shows that, in spite of considerable obstruction from
roughness of bed, large quantities of sand may be taken up
and carried off by streams of no great rapidity of inclination;
for the whole descent of the bed of the river between the two
dams&mdash;a distance of four miles&mdash;is but sixty feet, or fifteen feet
to the mile.</p>


<h4><i>The Po and its Deposits.</i></h4>

<p>The current of the river Po, for a considerable distance
after its volume of water is otherwise sufficient for continuous
navigation, is too rapid for that purpose until near Piacenza,
where its velocity becomes too much reduced to transport
great quantities of mineral matter, except in a state of minute
division. Its southern affluents bring down from the Apennines
a large quantity of fine earth from various geological
formations, while its Alpine tributaries west of the Ticino are
charged chiefly with rock ground down to sand or gravel.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
The bed of the river has been somewhat elevated by the deposits
in its channel, though not by any means above the level
of the adjacent plains as has been so often represented. The
dikes, which confine the current at high water, at the same
time augment its velocity and compel it to carry most of its
sediment to the Adriatic. It has, therefore, raised neither its
own channel nor its alluvial shores, as it would have done if it
had remained unconfined. But, as the surface of the water in
floods is from six to fifteen feet above the general level of its
banks, the Po can, at that period, receive no contributions of
earth from the washing of the fields of Lombardy, and there is
no doubt that a large proportion of the sediment it now deposits
at its mouth descended from the Alps in the form of
rock, though reduced by the grinding action of the waters, in
its passage seaward, to the condition of fine sand, and often
of silt.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>We know little of the history of the Po, or of the geography
of the coast near the point where it enters the Adriatic,
at any period more than twenty centuries before our own.
Still less can we say how much of the plains of Lombardy had
been formed by its action, combined with other causes, before
man accelerated its levelling operations by felling the first
woods on the mountains whence its waters are derived. But
we know that since the Roman conquest of Northern Italy, its
deposits have amounted to a quantity which, if recemented
into rock, recombined into gravel, common earth, and vegetable
mould, and restored to the situations where eruption or
upheaval originally placed, or vegetation deposited it, would
fill up hundreds of deep ravines in the Alps and Apennines,
change the plan and profile of their chains, and give their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
southern and northern faces respectively a geographical aspect
very different from that they now present. Ravenna, forty
miles south of the principal mouth of the Po, was built like
Venice, in a lagoon, and the Adriatic still washed its walls at
the commencement of the Christian era. The mud of the Po
has filled up the lagoon, and Ravenna is now four miles from
the sea. The town of Adria, which lies between the Po and
the Adige, at the distance of some four or five miles from each,
was once a harbor famous enough to have given its name to
the Adriatic sea, and it was still a seaport in the time of Augustus.
The combined action of the two rivers has so advanced
the coast line that Adria is now about fourteen miles inland,
and, in other places, the deposits made within the same period
by these and other neighboring streams have a width of
twenty miles.</p>

<p>What proportion of the earth with which they are charged
these rivers have borne out into deep water, during the last two
thousand years, we do not know, but as they still transport
enormous quantities, as the North Adriatic appears to have
shoaled rapidly, and as long islands, composed in great part
of fluviatile deposits, have formed opposite their mouths, it
must evidently have been very great. The floods of the Po
occur but once, or sometimes twice in a year.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> At other
times, its waters are comparatively limpid and seem to hold
no great amount of mud or fine sand in mechanical suspension;
but at high water it contains a large proportion of solid matter,
and according to Lombardini, it annually transports to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
shores of the Adriatic not less than 42,760,000 cubic m&egrave;tres,
or very nearly 55,000,000 cubic yards, which carries the coast
line out into the sea at the rate of more than 200 feet in a
year.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> The depth of the annual deposit is stated at eighteen
centim&egrave;tres, or rather more than seven inches, and it would
cover an area of not much less than ninety square miles with
a layer of that thickness. The Adige, also, brings every year
to the Adriatic many million cubic yards of Alpine detritus,
and the contributions of the Brenta from the same source are
far from inconsiderable. The Adriatic, however, receives but
a small proportion of the soil and rock washed away from the
Italian slope of the Alps and the northern declivity of the
Apennines by torrents. Nearly the whole of the debris thus
removed from the southern face of the Alps between Monte
Rosa and the sources of the Adda&mdash;a length of watershed not
less than one hundred and fifty miles&mdash;is arrested by the still
waters of the Lakes Maggiore and Como, and some smaller
lacustrine reservoirs, and never reaches the sea. The Po is
not continuously embanked except for the lower half of its
course. Above Piacenza, therefore, it spreads and deposits
sediment over a wide surface, and the water withdrawn from
it for irrigation at lower points, as well as its inundations in
the occasional ruptures of its banks, carry over the adjacent
soil a large amount of slime.</p>

<p>If we add to the estimated annual deposits of the Po at its
mouth, the earth and sand transported to the sea by the Adige,
the Brenta, and other less important streams, the prodigious
mass of detritus swept into Lago Maggiore by the Tosa, the
Maggia, and the Ticino, into the lake of Como by the Maira<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
and the Adda, into the lake of Garda by its affluents, and the
yet vaster heaps of pebbles, gravel, and earth permanently
deposited by the torrents near their points of eruption from
mountain gorges, or spread over the wide plains at lower
levels, we may safely assume that we have an aggregate of not
less than four times the quantity carried to the Adriatic by the
Po, or 220,000,000 cubic yards of solid matter, abstracted every
year from the Italian Alps and the Apennines, and removed
out of their domain by the force of running water.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>The present rate of deposit at the mouth of the Po has continued
since the year 1600, the previous advance of the coast,
after the year 1200, having been only one third as rapid. The
great increase of erosion and transport is ascribed by Lombardini
chiefly to the destruction of the forests in the basin of that
river and the valleys, of its tributaries, since the beginning of
the seventeenth century.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> We have no data to show the rate
of deposit in any given century before the year 1200, and it
doubtless varied according to the progress of population and
the consequent extension of clearing and cultivation. The
transporting power of torrents is greatest soon after their formation,
because at that time their points of delivery are lower,
and, of course, their general slope and velocity more rapid,
than after years of erosion above, and deposit below, have
depressed the beds of their mountain valleys, and elevated the
channels of their lower course. Their eroding action also is
most powerful at the same period, both because their mechanical
force is then greatest, and because the loose earth and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
stones of freshly cleared forest ground are most easily removed.
Many of the Alpine valleys west of the Ticino&mdash;that of the
Dora Baltea for instance&mdash;were nearly stripped of their forests
in the days of the Roman empire, others in the Middle Ages,
and, of course, there must have been, at different periods before
the year 1200, epochs when the erosion and transportation of
solid matter from the Alps and the Apennines were as great as
since the year 1600.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, we shall not greatly err if we assume
that, for a period of not less than two thousand years, the
walls of the basin of the Po&mdash;the Italian slope of the Alps,
and the northern and northeastern declivities of the Apennines&mdash;have
annually sent down into the Adriatic, the lakes,
and the plains, not less than 150,000,000 cubic yards of earth
and disintegrated rock. We have, then, an aggregate of
300,000,000,000 cubic yards of such material, which, allowing
to the mountain surface in question an area of 50,000,000,000
square yards, would cover the whole to the depth of six yards.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
There are very large portions of this area, where, as we know
from ancient remains&mdash;roads, bridges, and the like&mdash;from
other direct testimony, and from geological considerations,
very little degradation has taken place within twenty centuries,
and hence the quantity to be assigned to localities
where the destructive causes have been most active is increased
in proportion.</p>

<p>If this vast mass of pulverized rock and earth were restored
to the localities from which it was derived, it certainly would
not obliterate valleys and gorges hollowed out by great geological
causes, but it would reduce the length and diminish
the depth of ravines of later formation, modify the inclination
of their walls, reclothe with earth many bare mountain ridges,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
essentially change the line of junction between plain and
mountain, and carry back a long reach of the Adriatic coast
many miles to the west.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>It is, indeed, not to be supposed that all the degradation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
of the mountains is due to the destruction of the forests&mdash;that
the flanks of every Alpine valley in Central Europe below the
snow line were once covered with earth and green with woods,
but there are not many particular cases, in which we can, with
certainty, or even with strong probability, affirm the contrary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>We cannot measure the share which human action has had
in augmenting the intensity of causes of mountain degradation,
but we know that the clearing of the woods has, in some cases,
produced within two or three generations, effects as blasting
as those generally ascribed to geological convulsions, and has
laid waste the face of the earth more hopelessly than if it had
been buried by a current of lava or a shower of volcanic sand.
Now torrents are forming every year in the Alps. Tradition,
written records, and analogy concur to establish the belief that
the ruin of most of the now desolate valleys in those mountains
is to be ascribed to the same cause, and authentic descriptions
of the irresistible force of the torrent show that, aided by frost
and heat, it is adequate to level Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa
themselves, unless new upheavals shall maintain their elevation.</p>

<p>It has been contended that all rivers which take their rise
in mountains originated in torrents. These, it is said, have
lowered the summits by gradual erosion, and, with the material
thus derived, have formed shoals in the sea which once
beat against the cliffs; then, by successive deposits, gradually
raised them above the surface, and finally expanded them into
broad plains traversed by gently flowing streams. If we could
go back to earlier geological periods, we should find this theory
often verified, and we cannot fail to see that the torrents go on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
at the present hour, depressing still lower the ridges of the
Alps and the Apennines, raising still higher the plains of
Lombardy and Provence, extending the coast still farther into
the Adriatic and the Mediterranean, reducing the inclination
of their own beds and the rapidity of their flow, and thus
tending to become river-like in character.</p>

<p>There are cases where torrents cease their ravages of themselves,
in consequence of some change in the condition of the
basin where they originate, or of the face of the mountain at a
higher level, while the plain or the sea below remains in substantially
the same state as before. If a torrent rises in a
small valley containing no great amount of earth and of disintegrated
or loose rock, it may, in the course of a certain period,
wash out all the transportable material, and if the valley is
then left with solid walls, it will cease to furnish debris to be
carried down by floods. If, in this state of things, a new
channel be formed at an elevation above the head of the valley,
it may divert a part, or even the whole of the rain water
and melted snow which would otherwise have flowed into it,
and the once furious torrent now sinks to the rank of a humble
and harmless brooklet. "In traversing this department,"
says Surell, "one often sees, at the outlet of a gorge, a flattened
hillock, with a fan-shaped outline and regular slopes; it
is the bed of dejection of an ancient torrent. It sometimes
requires long and careful study to detect the primitive form,
masked as it is by groves of trees, by cultivated fields, and
often by houses, but, when examined closely, and from different
points of view, its characteristic figure manifestly appears,
and its true history cannot be mistaken. Along the hillock
flows a streamlet, issuing from the ravine, and quietly watering
the fields. This was originally a torrent, and in the background
may be discovered its mountain basin. Such <i>extinguished</i>
torrents, if I may use the expression, are numerous."<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>But for the intervention of man and domestic animals, these
latter beneficent revolutions would occur more frequently, proceed
more rapidly. The new scarped mountains, the hillocks
of debris, the plains elevated by sand and gravel spread over
them, the shores freshly formed by fluviatile deposits, would
clothe themselves with shrubs and trees, the intensity of the
causes of degradation would be diminished, and nature would
thus regain her ancient equilibrium. But these processes,
under ordinary circumstances, demand, not years, generations,
but centuries;<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> and man, who even now finds scarce breathing
room on this vast globe, cannot retire from the Old World to
some yet undiscovered continent, and wait for the slow action
of such causes to replace, by a new creation, the Eden he has
wasted.</p>


<h4><i>Mountain Slides.</i></h4>

<p>I have said that the mountainous regions of the Atlantic
States of the American Union are exposed to similar ravages,
and I may add that there is, in some cases, reason to apprehend
from the same cause even more appalling calamities than
those which I have yet described. The slide in the Notch of
the White Mountains, by which the Willey family lost their
lives, is an instance of the sort I refer to, though I am not able
to say that in this particular case, the slip of the earth and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
rock was produced by the denudation of the surface. It may
have been occasioned by this cause, or by the construction of
the road through the Notch, the excavations for which, perhaps,
cut through the buttresses that supported the sloping
strata above.</p>

<p>Not to speak of the fall of earth when the roots which held
it together, and the bed of leaves and mould which sheltered
it both from disintegrating frost and from sudden drenching
and dissolution by heavy showers, are gone, it is easy to see
that, in a climate with severe winters, the removal of the forest,
and, consequently, of the soil it had contributed to form,
might cause the displacement and descent of great masses of
rock. The woods, the vegetable mould, and the soil beneath,
protect the rocks they cover from the direct action of heat and
cold, and from the expansion and contraction which accompany
them. Most rocks, while covered with earth, contain a
considerable quantity of water.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> A fragment of rock pervaded
with moisture cracks and splits, if thrown into a furnace,
and sometimes with a loud detonation; and it is a familiar
observation that the fire, in burning over newly cleared lands,
breaks up and sometimes almost pulverizes the stones. This
effect is due partly to the unequal expansion of the stone, partly
to the action of heat on the water it contains in its pores. The
sun, suddenly let in upon rock which had been covered with
moist earth for centuries, produces more or less disintegration
in the same way, and the stone is also exposed to chemical
influences from which it was sheltered before. But in the
climate of the United States as well as of the Alps, frost is a
still more powerful agent in breaking up mountain masses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
The soil that protects the lime and sand stone, the slate and
the granite from the influence of the sun, also prevents the
water which filters into their crevices and between their strata
from freezing in the hardest winters, and the moisture descends,
in a liquid form, until it escapes in springs, or passes
off by deep subterranean channels. But when the ridges are
laid bare, the water of the autumnal rains fills the minutest
pores and veins and fissures and lines of separation of the
rocks, then suddenly freezes, and bursts asunder huge, and
apparently solid blocks of adamantine stone.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Where the
strata are inclined at a considerable angle, the freezing of a
thin film of water over a large interstratal area might occasion
a slide that should cover miles with its ruins; and similar
results might be produced by the simple hydrostatic pressure
of a column of water, admitted by the removal of the covering
of earth to flow into a crevice faster than it could escape
through orifices below.</p>

<p>Earth or rather mountain slides, compared to which the
catastrophe that buried the Willey family in New Hampshire
was but a pinch of dust, have often occurred in the Swiss
Italian, and French Alps. The land slip, which overwhelmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
and covered to the depth of seventy feet, the town of Plurs in
the valley of the Maira, on the night of the 4th of September,
1618, sparing not a soul of a population of 2,430 inhabitants,
is one of the most memorable of these catastrophes, and the
fall of the Rossberg or Rufiberg, which destroyed the little town
of Goldau in Switzerland, and 450 of its people, on the 2d of
September, 1806, is almost equally celebrated. In 1771, according
to Wessely, the mountain peak Piz, near Alleghe in
the province of Belluno, slipped into the bed of the Cordevole,
a tributary of the Piave, destroying in its fall three hamlets
and sixty lives. The rubbish filled the valley for a distance
of nearly two miles, and, by damming up the waters of the
Cordevole, formed a lake about three miles long, and a hundred
and fifty feet deep, which still subsists, though reduced
to half its original length by the wearing down of its outlet.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>On the 14th of February, 1855, the hill of Belmonte, a little
below the parish of San Stefano, in Tuscany, slid into the valley
of the Tiber, which consequently flooded the village to the
depth of fifty feet, and was finally drained off by a tunnel.
The mass of debris is stated to have been about 3,500 feet
long, 1,000 wide, and not less than 600 high.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>Such displacements of earth and rocky strata rise to the
magnitude of geological convulsions, but they are of so rare
occurrence in countries still covered by the primitive forest, so
common where the mountains have been stripped of their
native covering, and, in many cases, so easily explicable by
the drenching of incohesive earth from rain, or the free admission
of water between the strata of rocks&mdash;both of which a
coating of vegetation would have prevented&mdash;that we are justified
in ascribing them for the most part to the same cause as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
that to which the destructive effects of mountain torrents are
chiefly due&mdash;the felling of the woods.</p>

<p>In nearly every case of this sort the circumstances of which
are known, the immediate cause of the slip has been, either an
earthquake, the imbibition of water in large quantities by bare
earth, or its introduction between or beneath solid strata. If
water insinuates itself between the strata, it creates a sliding
surface, or it may, by its expansion in freezing, separate beds
of rock, which had been nearly continuous before, widely
enough to allow the gravitation of the superincumbent mass
to overcome the resistance afforded by inequalities of face and
by friction; if it finds its way beneath hard earth or rock
reposing on clay or other bedding of similar properties, it converts
the supporting layer into a semi-fluid mud, which opposes
no obstacle to the sliding of the strata above.</p>

<p>The upper part of the mountain which buried Goldau was
composed of a hard but brittle conglomerate, called <i>nagelflue</i>,
resting on an unctuous clay, and inclining rapidly toward the
village. Much earth remained upon the rock, in irregular
masses, but the woods had been felled, and the water had free
access to the surface, and to the crevices which sun and frost
had already produced in the rock, and of course, to the slimy
stratum beneath. The whole summer of 1806 had been very
wet, and an almost incessant deluge of rain had fallen the day
preceding the catastrophe, as well as on that of its occurrence.
All conditions then, were favorable to the sliding of the rock,
and, in obedience to the laws of gravitation, it precipitated itself
into the valley as soon as its adhesion to the earth beneath it
was destroyed by the conversion of the latter into a viscous
paste. The mass that fell measured between two and a half
and three miles in length by one thousand feet in width, and
its average thickness is thought to have been about a hundred
feet. The highest portion of the mountain was more than
three thousand feet above the village, and the momentum
acquired by the rocks and earth in their descent carried huge
blocks of stone far up the opposite slope of the Rigi.</p>

<p>The Piz, which fell into the Cordevole, rested on a steeply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
inclined stratum of limestone, with a thin layer of calcareous
marl intervening, which, by long exposure to frost and the
infiltration of water, had lost its original consistence, and
become a loose and slippery mass instead of a cohesive and
tenacious bed.</p>


<h4><i>Protection against fall of Rocks and Avalanches by Trees.</i></h4>

<p>Forests often subserve a valuable purpose in preventing
the fall of rocks, by mere mechanical resistance. Trees, as
well as herbaceous vegetation, grow in the Alps upon declivities
of surprising steepness of inclination, and the traveller sees
both luxuriant grass and flourishing woods on slopes at which
the soil, in the dry air of lower regions, would crumble and
fall by the weight of its own particles. When loose rocks lie
scattered on the face of these declivities, they are held in place
by the trunks of the trees, and it is very common to observe a
stone that weighs hundreds of pounds, perhaps even tons, resting
against a tree which has stopped its progress just as it was
beginning to slide down to a lower level. When a forest in
such a position is cut, these blocks lose their support, and a
single wet season is enough not only to bare the face of a considerable
extent of rock, but to cover with earth and stone
many acres of fertile soil below.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>In Switzerland and other snowy and mountainous countries,
forests render a most important service by preventing
the formation and fall of destructive avalanches, and in many
parts of the Alps exposed to this catastrophe, the woods are
protected, though too often ineffectually, by law. No forest,
indeed, could arrest a large avalanche once in motion, but the
mechanical resistance afforded by the trees prevents their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
formation, both by obstructing the wind, which gives to the
dry snow of the <i>Staub-Lawine</i>, or dust avalanche, its first
impulse, and by checking the disposition of moist snow to
gather itself into what is called the <i>Rutsch-Lawine</i>, or sliding
avalanche. Marschand states that, the very first winter after
the felling of the trees on the higher part of a declivity between
Saanen and Gsteig where the snow had never been
known to slide, an avalanche formed itself in the clearing,
thundered down the mountain, and overthrew and carried with
it a hitherto unviolated forest to the amount of nearly a million
cubic feet of timber.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> The path once opened down the flanks
of the mountain, the evil is almost beyond remedy. The snow
sometimes carries off the earth from the face of the rock, or, if
the soil is left, fresh slides every winter destroy the young
plantations, and the restoration of the wood becomes impossible.
The track widens with every new avalanche. Dwellings
and their occupants are buried in the snow, or swept
away by the rushing mass, or by the furious blasts it occasions
through the displacement of the air; roads and bridges are
destroyed; rivers blocked up, which swell till they overflow
the valley above, and then, bursting their snowy barrier, flood
the fields below with all the horrors of a winter inundation.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>


<h4><i>Principal Causes of the Destruction of the Forest.</i></h4>

<p>The needs of agriculture are the most familiar cause of the
destruction of the forest in new countries; for not only does
an increasing population demand additional acres to grow the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
vegetables which feed it and its domestic animals, but the slovenly
husbandry of the border settler soon exhausts the luxuriance
of his first fields, and compels him to remove his
household gods to a fresher soil. With growing numbers, too,
come the many arts for which wood is the material. The
demands of the near and the distant market for this product
excite the cupidity of the hardy forester, and a few years of
that wild industry of which Springer's "Forest Life and Forest
Trees" so vividly depicts the dangers and the triumphs,
suffice to rob the most inaccessible glens of their fairest ornaments.
The value of timber increases with its dimensions in
almost geometrical proportion, and the tallest, most vigorous,
and most symmetrical trees fall the first sacrifice. This is a
fortunate circumstance for the remainder of the wood; for the
impatient lumberman contents himself with felling a few of
the best trees, and then hurries on to take his tithe of still
virgin groves.</p>

<p>The unparalleled facilities for internal navigation, afforded
by the numerous rivers of the present and former British colonial
possessions in North America, have proved very fatal to
the forests of that continent. Quebec has become a centre for
a lumber trade, which, in the bulk of its material, and, consequently,
in the tonnage required for its transportation, rivals
the commerce of the greatest European cities. Immense rafts
are collected at Quebec from the great Lakes, from the Ottawa,
and from all the other tributaries which unite to swell the current
of the St. Lawrence and help it to struggle against its
mighty tides.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Ships, of burden formerly undreamed of, have
been built to convey the timber to the markets of Europe, and
during the summer months the St. Lawrence is almost as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
crowded with vessels as the Thames.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Of late, Chicago, in
Illinois, has been one of the greatest lumber as well as grain
depots of the United States, and it receives and distributes
contributions from all the forests in the States washed by Lake
Michigan, as well as from some more distant points.</p>

<p>The operations of the lumberman involve other dangers to
the woods besides the loss of the trees felled by him. The
narrow clearings around his <i>shanties</i><a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> form openings which let
in the wind, and thus sometimes occasion the overthrow of
thousands of trees, the fall of which dams up small streams,
and creates bogs by the spreading of the waters, while the
decaying trunks facilitate the multiplication of the insects
which breed in dead wood, and are, some of them, injurious to
living trees. The escape and spread of camp fires, however, is
the most devastating of all the causes of destruction that find
their origin in the operations of the lumberman. The proportion
of trees fit for industrial uses is small in all primitive
woods. Only these fall before the forester's axe, but the fire
destroys, indiscriminately, every age and every species of tree.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
While, then, without much injury to the younger growths, the
native forest will bear several "cuttings over" in a generation&mdash;for
the increasing value of lumber brings into use, every
four or five years, a quality of timber which had been before
rejected as unmarketable&mdash;a fire may render the declivity of a
mountain unproductive for a century.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>American Forest Trees.</i></h4>

<p>The remaining forests of the Northern States and of Canada
no longer boast the mighty pines which almost rivalled the
gigantic Sequoia of California; and the growth of the larger
forest trees is so slow, after they have attained to a certain
size, that if every pine and oak were spared for two centuries,
the largest now standing would not reach the stature of hundreds
recorded to have been cut within two or three generations.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
Dr. Williams, who wrote about sixty years ago, states
the following as the dimensions of "such trees as are esteemed
large ones of their kind in that part of America" [Vermont],
qualifying his account with the remark that his measurements
"do not denote the greatest which nature has produced of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
their particular species, but the greatest which are to be found
in most of our towns."</p>

<p>He adds a note saying that a white pine was cut in Dunstable,
New Hampshire, in the year 1736, the diameter of
which was seven feet and eight inches. Dr. Dwight says that
a fallen pine in Connecticut was found to measure two hundred
and forty-seven feet in height, and adds: "A few years
since, such trees were in great numbers along the northern
parts of Connecticut River." In another letter, he speaks of
the white pine as "frequently six feet in diameter, and two
hundred and fifty feet in height," and states that a pine had
been cut in Lancaster, New Hampshire, which measured two
hundred and sixty-four feet. Emerson wrote in 1846: "Fifty
years ago, several trees growing on rather dry land in Blandford,
Massachusetts, measured, after they were felled, two
hundred and twenty-three feet. All these trees are surpassed
by a pine felled at Hanover, New Hampshire, about a hundred
years ago, and described as measuring two hundred and seventy-four
feet.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>These descriptions, it will be noticed, apply to trees cut
from sixty to one hundred years since. Persons, whom observation
has rendered familiar with the present character of
the American forest, will be struck with the smallness of the
diameter which Dr. Williams and Dr. Dwight ascribe to trees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
of such extraordinary height. Individuals of the several species
mentioned in Dr. Williams's table, are now hardly to be
found in the same climate, exceeding one half or at most two
thirds of the height which he assigns to them; but, except in
the case of the oak and the pine, the diameter stated by him
would not be thought very extraordinary in trees of far less
height, now standing. Even in the species I have excepted,
those diameters, with half the heights of Dr. Williams, might
perhaps be paralleled at the present time; and many elms,
transplanted, at a diameter of six inches, within the memory
of persons still living, measure six, and sometimes even seven
feet through. For this change in the growth of forest trees
there are two reasons: the one is, that the great commercial
value of the pine and the oak have caused the destruction of
all the best&mdash;that is, the tallest and straightest&mdash;specimens of
both; the other, that the thinning of the woods by the axe of
the lumberman has allowed the access of light and heat and
air to trees of humbler worth and lower stature, which have
survived their more towering brethren. These, consequently,
have been able to expand their crowns and swell their stems
to a degree not possible so long as they were overshadowed
and stifled by the lordly oak and pine. While, therefore, the
New England forester must search long before he finds a pine</p>

<p>Another evil, sometimes of serious magnitude, which attends
the operations of the lumberman, is the injury to the
banks of rivers from the practice of floating. I do not here
allude to rafts, which, being under the control of those who
navigate them, may be so guided as to avoid damage to the
shore, but to masts, logs, and other pieces of timber singly
intrusted to the streams, to be conveyed by their currents to
sawmill ponds, or to convenient places for collecting them
into rafts. The lumbermen usually haul the timber to the
banks of the rivers in the winter, and when the spring floods
swell the streams and break up the ice, they roll the logs into
the water, leaving them to float down to their destination. If
the transporting stream is too small to furnish a sufficient channel
for this rude navigation, it is sometimes dammed up, and
the timber collected in the pond thus formed above the dam.
When the pond is full, a sluice is opened, or the dam is blown
up or otherwise suddenly broken, and the whole mass of lumber
above it is hurried down with the rolling flood. Both of
these modes of proceeding expose the banks of the rivers
employed as channels of flotation to abrasion,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> and in some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
the American States it has been found necessary to protect, by
special legislation, the lands through which they flow from the
serious injury sometimes received through the practices I have
described.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>


<h4><i>Special Causes of the Destruction of European Woods.</i></h4>

<p>The causes of forest waste thus far enumerated are more
or less common to both continents; but in Europe extensive
woods have, at different periods, been deliberately destroyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
by fire or the axe, because they afforded a retreat to enemies,
robbers, and outlaws, and this practice is said to have been
resorted to in the Mediterranean provinces of France as recently
as the time of Napoleon I.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> The severe and even sanguinary
legislation, by which some of the governments of
medi&aelig;val Europe, as well as of earlier ages, protected the
woods, was dictated by a love of the chase, or the fear of a
scarcity of fuel and timber. The laws of almost every European
state more or less adequately secure the permanence of
the forest; and I believe Spain is the only European land
which has not made some public provision for the protection
and restoration of the woods&mdash;the only country whose people
systematically war upon the garden of God.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Royal Forests and Game Laws.</i></h4>

<p>The French authors I have quoted, as well as many other
writers of the same nation, refer to the French Revolution as
having given a new impulse to destructive causes which were
already threatening the total extermination of the woods.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
The general crusade against the forests, which accompanied
that important event, is to be ascribed, in a considerable degree,
to political resentments. The forest codes of the medi&aelig;val
kings, and the local "coutumes" of feudalism contained
many severe and even inhuman provisions, adopted rather for
the preservation of game than from any enlightened views of
the more important functions of the woods. Ordericus Vitalis
informs us that William the Conqueror destroyed sixty parishes,
and drove out their inhabitants, in order that he might
turn their lands into a forest,<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> to be reserved as a hunting
ground for himself and his posterity, and he punished with
death the killing of a deer, wild boar, or even a hare. His
successor, William Rufus, according to the <i>Histoire des Ducs
de Normandie et des Rois d'Angleterre</i>, p. 67, "was hunting
one day in a new forest, which he had caused to be made out
of eighteen parishes that he had destroyed, when, by mis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>chance,
he was killed by an arrow wherewith Tyreus de Rois
[Sir Walter Tyrell] thought to slay a beast, but missed the
beast, and slew the king, who was beyond it. And in this
very same forest, his brother Richard ran so hard against a
tree that he died of it. And men commonly said that these
things were because they had so laid waste and taken the said
parishes."</p>

<p>These barbarous acts, as Bonnem&egrave;re observes,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> were simply
the transfer of the customs of the French kings, of their vassals,
and even of inferior gentlemen, to conquered England. "The
death of a hare," says our author, "was a hanging matter, the
murder of a plover a capital crime. Death was inflicted on
those who spread nets for pigeons; wretches who had drawn a
bow upon a stag were to be tied to the animal alive; and
among the seigniors it was a standing excuse for having killed
game on forbidden ground, that they aimed at a serf." The
feudal lords enforced these codes with unrelenting rigor, and
not unfrequently took the law into their own hands. In the
time of Louis IX, according to William of Nangis, "three
noble children, born in Flanders, who were sojourning at the
abbey of St. Nicholas in the Wood, to learn the speech of
France, went out into the forest of the abbey, with their bows
and iron-headed arrows, to disport them in shooting hares,
chased the game, which they had started in the wood of the
abbey, into the forest of Enguerrand, lord of Coucy, and were
taken by the sergeants which kept the wood. When the fell
and pitiless Sir Enguerrand knew this, he had the children
straightway hanged without any manner of trial."<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
matter being brought to the notice of good King Louis, Sir
Enguerrand was summoned to appear, and, finally, after many
feudal shifts and dilatory pleas, brought to trial before Louis
himself and a special council. Notwithstanding the opposition
of the other seigniors, who, it is needless to say, spared no
efforts to save a peer, probably not a greater criminal than
themselves, the king was much inclined to inflict the punishment
of death on the proud baron. "If he believed," said he,
"that our Lord would be as well content with hanging as with
pardoning, he would hang Sir Enguerrand in spite of all his
barons;" but noble and clerical interests unfortunately prevailed.
The king was persuaded to inflict a milder retribution,
and the murderer was condemned to pay ten thousand
livres in coin, and to "build for the souls of the three children
two chapels wherein mass should be said every day."<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> The
hope of shortening the purgatorial term of the young persons,
by the religious rites to be celebrated in the chapels, was
doubtless the consideration which operated most powerfully
on the mind of the king; and Europe lost a great example for
the sake of a mass.</p>

<p>The desolation and depopulation, resulting from the exten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>sion
of the forest and the enforcement of the game laws,
induced several of the French kings to consent to some relaxation
of the severity of these latter. Francis I, however, revived
their barbarous provisions, and, according to Bonnem&egrave;re,
even so good a monarch as Henry IV re&euml;nacted them,
and "signed the sentence of death upon peasants guilty of
having defended their fields against devastation by wild
beasts." "A fine of twenty livres," he continues, "was imposed
on every one shooting at pigeons, which, at that time,
swooped down by thousands upon the new-sown fields and
devoured the seed. But let us count even this a progress, for
we have seen that the murder of a pigeon had been a capital
crime."<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>Not only were the slightest trespasses on the forest domain&mdash;the
cutting of an oxgoad, for instance&mdash;severely punished,
but game animals were still sacred when they had wandered
from their native precincts and were ravaging the fields of the
peasantry. A herd of deer or of wild boars often consumed
or trod down a harvest of grain, the sole hope of the year for
a whole family; and the simple driving out of such animals
from this costly pasturage brought dire vengeance on the head
of the rustic, who had endeavored to save his children's bread
from their voracity. "At all times," says Paul Louis Courier,
speaking in the name of the peasants of Chambord, in the
"Simple Discours," "the game has made war upon us. Paris
was blockaded eight hundred years by the deer, and its environs,
now so rich, so fertile, did not yield bread enough to
support the gamekeepers."<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>In the popular mind, the forest was associated with all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
abuses of feudalism, and the evils the peasantry had suffered
from the legislation which protected both it and the game it
sheltered, blinded them to the still greater physical mischiefs
which its destruction was to entail upon them. No longer
protected by law, the crown forests and those of the great
lords were attacked with relentless fury, unscrupulously plundered
and wantonly laid waste, and even the rights of property
in small private woods were no longer respected.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
Various absurd theories, some of which are not even yet
exploded, were propagated with regard to the economical
advantages of converting the forest into pasture and plough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>land,
its injurious effects upon climate, health, facility of
internal communication, and the like. Thus resentful memory
of the wrongs associated with the forest, popular ignorance,
and the cupidity of speculators cunning enough to turn these
circumstances to profitable account, combined to hasten the
sacrifice of the remaining woods, and a waste was produced
which hundreds of years and millions of treasure will hardly
repair.</p>


<h4><i>Small Forest Plants, and Vitality of Seed.</i></h4>

<p>Another function of the woods to which I have barely
alluded deserves a fuller notice than can be bestowed upon it
in a treatise the scope of which is purely economical. The
forest is the native habitat of a large number of humbler
plants, to the growth and perpetuation of which its shade, its
humidity, and its vegetable mould appear to be indispensable
necessities.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> We cannot positively say that the felling of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
woods in a given vegetable province would involve the final
extinction of the smaller plants which are found only within
their precincts. Some of these, though not naturally propagating
themselves in the open ground, may perhaps germinate
and grow under artificial stimulation and protection, and
finally become hardy enough to maintain an independent
existence in very different circumstances from those which at
present seem essential to their life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides this, although the accounts of the growth of seeds,
which have lain for ages in the ashy dryness of Egyptian catacombs,
are to be received with great caution, or, more probably,
to be rejected altogether, yet their vitality seems almost
imperishable while they remain in the situations in which
nature deposits them. When a forest old enough to have
witnessed the mysteries of the Druids is felled, trees of other
species spring up in its place; and when they, in their turn,
fall before the axe, sometimes even as soon as they have
spread their protecting shade over the surface, the germs
which their predecessors had shed years, perhaps centuries
before, sprout up, and in due time, if not choked by other
trees belonging to a later stage in the order of natural succession,
restore again the original wood. In these cases, the
seeds of the new crop may often have been brought by the
wind, by birds, by quadrupeds, or by other causes; but, in
many instances, this explanation is not probable.</p>

<p>When newly cleared ground is burnt over in the United
States, the ashes are hardly cold before they are covered with
a crop of fire weed, a tall herbaceous plant, very seldom seen
growing under other circumstances, and often not to be found
for a distance of many miles from the clearing. Its seeds,
whether the fruit of an ancient vegetation or newly sown by
winds or birds, require either a quickening by a heat which
raises to a certain high point the temperature of the stratum
where they lie buried, or a special pabulum furnished only by
the combustion of the vegetable remains that cover the ground
in the woods. Earth brought up from wells or other excavations
soon produces a harvest of plants often very unlike those
of the local flora.</p>

<p>Moritz Wagner, as quoted by Wittwer,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> remarks in his
description of Mount Ararat: "A singular phenomenon to
which my guide drew my attention is the appearance of several
plants on the earth-heaps left by the last catastrophe [an
earthquake], which grow nowhere else on the mountain, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
had never been observed in this region before. The seeds of
these plants were probably brought by birds, and found in the
loose, clayey soil remaining from the streams of mud, the conditions
of growth which the other soil of the mountain refused
them." This is probable enough, but it is hardly less so that
the flowing mud brought them up to the influence of air and
sun, from depths where a previous convulsion had buried them
ages before. Seeds of small sylvan plants, too deeply buried
by successive layers of forest foliage and the mould resulting
from its decomposition to be reached by the plough when the
trees are gone and the ground brought under cultivation, may,
if a wiser posterity replants the wood which sheltered their
parent stems, germinate and grow, after lying for generations
in a state of suspended animation.</p>

<p>Darwin says: "In Staffordshire, on the estate of a relation,
where I had ample means of investigation, there was a large
and extremely barren heath, which had never been touched by
the hand of man, but several hundred acres of exactly the
same nature had been enclosed twenty-five years previously
and planted with Scotch fir. The change in the native vegetation
of the planted part of the heath was most remarkable&mdash;more
than is generally seen in passing from one quite different
soil to another; not only the proportional numbers of the
heath plants were wholly changed, but <i>twelve species</i> of plants
(not counting grasses and sedges) flourished in the plantation
which could not be found on the heath."<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Had the author
informed us that these twelve plants belonged to a species whose
seeds enter into the nutriment of the birds which appeared
with the young wood, we could easily account for their presence
in the soil; but he says distinctly that the birds were of
insectivorous species, and it therefore seems more probable
that the seeds had been deposited when an ancient forest protected
the growth of the plants which bore them, and that
they sprang up to new life when a return of favorable conditions
awaked them from a sleep of centuries. Darwin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
indeed says that the heath "had never been touched by the
hand of man." Perhaps not, after it became a heath; but
what evidence is there to control the general presumption
that this heath was preceded by a forest, in whose shade the
vegetables which dropped the seeds in question might have
grown?<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>Although, therefore, the destruction of a wood and the
reclaiming of the soil to agricultural uses suppose the death
of its smaller dependent flora, these revolutions do not exclude
the possibility of its resurrection. In a practical view of the
subject, however, we must admit that when the woodman fells
a tree he sacrifices the colony of humbler growths which had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
vegetated under its protection. Some wood plants are known
to possess valuable medicinal properties, and experiment may
show that the number of these is greater than we now suppose.
Few of them, however, have any other economical value than
that of furnishing a slender pasturage to cattle allowed to
roam in the woods; and even this small advantage is far
more than compensated by the mischief done to the young
trees by browsing animals. Upon the whole, the importance
of this class of vegetables, as physic or as food, is not such as
to furnish a very telling popular argument for the conservation
of the forest as a necessary means of their perpetuation. More
potent remedial agents may supply their place in the <i>materia
medica</i>, and an acre of grass land yields more nutriment for
cattle than a range of a hundred acres of forest. But he
whose sympathies with nature have taught him to feel that
there is a fellowship between all God's creatures; to love the
brilliant ore better than the dull ingot, iodic silver and crystallized
red copper better than the shillings and the pennies
forged from them by the coiner's cunning; a venerable oak
tree than the brandy cask whose staves are split out from its
heart wood; a bed of anemones, hepaticas, or wood violets
than the leeks and onions which he may grow on the soil they
have enriched and in the air they made fragrant&mdash;he who has
enjoyed that special training of the heart and intellect which
can be acquired only in the unviolated sanctuaries of nature,
"where man is distant, but God is near"&mdash;will not rashly
assert his right to extirpate a tribe of harmless vegetables,
barely because their products neither tickle his palate nor fill
his pocket; and his regret at the dwindling area of the forest
solitude will be augmented by the reflection that the nurselings
of the woodland perish with the pines, the oaks, and the
beeches that sheltered them.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>Although, as I have said, birds do not frequent the deeper
recesses of the wood,<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> yet a very large proportion of them
build their nests in trees, and find in their foliage and
branches a secure retreat from the inclemencies of the seasons
and the pursuit of the reptiles and quadrupeds which prey
upon them. The borders of the forests are vocal with song;
and when the gray morning calls the creeping things of the
earth out of their night cells, it summons from the neighboring
wood legions of their winged enemies, which swoop down
upon the fields to save man's harvests by devouring the destroying
worm, and surprising the lagging beetle in his tardy
retreat to the dark cover where he lurks through the hours of
daylight.</p>

<p>The insects most injurious to rural industry do not multiply
in or near the woods. The locust, which ravages the East
with its voracious armies, is bred in vast open plains which
admit the full heat of the sun to hasten the hatching of the
eggs, gather no moisture to destroy them, and harbor no bird
to feed upon the larv&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> It is only since the felling of the
forests of Asia Minor and Cyrene that the locust has become
so fearfully destructive in those countries; and the grasshopper,
which now threatens to be almost as great a pest to the
agriculture of some North American soils, breeds in seriously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
injurious numbers only where a wide extent of surface is bare
of woods.</p>


<h4><i>Utility of the Forest.</i></h4>

<p>In most parts of Europe, the woods are already so nearly
extirpated that the mere protection of those which now exist
is by no means an adequate remedy for the evils resulting
from the want of them; and besides, as I have already said,
abundant experience has shown that no legislation can secure
the permanence of the forest in private hands. Enlightened
individuals in most European states, governments in others,
have made very extensive plantations,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and France has now
set herself energetically at work to restore the woods in the
southern provinces, and thereby to prevent the utter depopulation
and waste with which that once fertile soil and delicious
climate are threatened.</p>

<p>The objects of the restoration of the forest are as multifarious
as the motives that have led to its destruction, and as the
evils which that destruction has occasioned. It is hoped that
the planting of the mountains will diminish the frequency and
violence of river inundations, prevent the formation of torrents,
mitigate the extremes of atmospheric temperature,
humidity, and precipitation, restore dried-up springs, rivulets,
and sources of irrigation, shelter the fields from chilling and
from parching winds, prevent the spread of miasmatic effluvia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
and, finally, furnish an inexhaustible and self-renewing supply
of a material indispensable to so many purposes of domestic
comfort, to the successful exercise of every art of peace, every
destructive energy of war.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>But our enumeration of the uses of trees is not yet complete.
Besides the influence of the forest, in mountain ranges,
as a means of preventing the scooping out of ravines and the
accumulations of water which fill them, trees subserve a valuable
purpose, in lower positions, as barriers against the spread
of floods and of the material they transport with them; but
this will be more appropriately considered in the chapter on
the waters; and another very important use of trees, that of
fixing movable sand-dunes, and reclaiming them to profitable
cultivation, will be pointed out in the chapter on the sands.</p>

<p>The vast extension of railroads, of manufactures and the
mechanical arts, of military armaments, and especially of the
commercial fleets and navies of Christendom within the present
century, has greatly augmented the demand for wood,<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
and, but for improvements in metallurgy which have facilitated
the substitution of iron for that material, the last twenty-five
years would almost have stripped Europe of her only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
remaining trees fit for such uses.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> The walnut trees alone
felled in Europe within two years to furnish the armies of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
America with gunstocks, would form a forest of no inconsiderable
extent.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>


<h4><i>The Forests of Europe.</i></h4>

<p>Mirabeau estimated the forests of France in 1750 at seventeen
millions of hectares [42,000,000 acres]; in 1860 they
were reduced to eight millions [19,769,000 acres]. This
would be at the rate of 82,000 hectares [202,600 acres] per
year. Troy, from whose valuable pamphlet, <i>&Eacute;tude sur le
Reboisement des Montagnes</i>, I take these statistical details,
supposes that Mirabeau's statement may have been an extravagant
one, but it still remains certain that the waste has been
enormous; for it is known that, in some departments, that of
Ari&egrave;ge, for instance, clearing has gone on during the last half
century at the rate of three thousand acres a year,<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> and in all
parts of the empire trees have been felled faster than they
have grown. The total area of France, excluding Savoy, is
about one hundred and thirty-one millions of acres. The
extent of forest supposed by Mirabeau would be about thirty-two
per cent. of the whole territory.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> In a country and a
climate where the conservative influences of the forest are so
necessary as in France, trees must cover a large surface and be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
grouped in large masses, in order to discharge to the best advantage
the various functions assigned to them by nature.
The consumption of wood is rapidly increasing in that empire,
and a large part of its territory is mountainous, sterile, and
otherwise such in character or situation that it can be more
profitably devoted to the growth of wood than to any agricultural
use. Hence it is evident that the proportion of forest
in 1750, taking even Mirabeau's large estimate, was not very
much too great for permanent maintenance, though doubtless
the distribution was so unequal that it would have been sound
policy to fell the woods and clear land in some provinces,
while large forests should have been planted in others.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Du<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>ring
the period in question, France neither exported manufactured
wood or rough timber, nor derived important collateral
advantages of any sort from the destruction of her forests.
She is consequently impoverished and crippled to the extent
of the difference between what she actually possesses of
wooded surface and what she ought to have retained.</p>

<p>Italy and Spain are bared of trees in a greater degree than
France, and even Russia, which we habitually consider as substantially
a forest country, is beginning to suffer seriously for
want of wood. Jourdier, as quoted by Clav&eacute;, observes: "Instead
of a vast territory with immense forests, which we expect
to meet, one sees only scattered groves thinned by the wind or
by the axe of the <i>moujik</i>, grounds cut over and more or less
recently cleared for cultivation. There is probably not a single
district in Russia which has not to deplore the ravages of man
or of fire, those two great enemies of Muscovite sylviculture.
This is so true, that clear-sighted men already foresee a crisis
which will become terrible, unless the discovery of great deposits
of some new combustible, as pit coal or anthracite, shall
diminish its evils."<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>Germany, from character of surface and climate, and from
the attention which has long been paid in all the German
States to sylviculture, is, taken as a whole, in a far better condition
in this respect than its more southern neighbors; but in
the Alpine provinces of Bavaria and Austria, the same improvidence
which marks the rural economy of the corresponding districts
of Switzerland, Italy, and France, is producing effects
hardly less disastrous. As an instance of the scarcity of fuel in
some parts of the territory of Bavaria, where, not long since,
wood abounded, I may mention the fact that the water of salt
springs is, in some instances, conveyed to the distance of sixty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
miles, in iron pipes, to reach a supply of fuel for boiling it
down.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>


<h4><i>Forests of the United States and Canada.</i></h4>

<p>The vast forests of the United States and Canada cannot
long resist the improvident habits of the backwoodsman and
the increased demand for lumber. According to the census
of the former country for 1860, which gives returns of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
"sawed and planed lumber" alone, timber for framing and
for a vast variety of mechanical purposes being omitted altogether,
the value of the former material prepared for market
in the United States was, in 1850, $58,521,976; in 1860,
$95,912,286. The quantity of unsawed lumber is not likely to
have increased in the same proportion, because comparatively
little is exported in that condition, and because masonry is fast
taking the place of carpentry in building, and stone, brick,
and iron are used instead of timber more largely than they
were ten years ago. Still a much greater quantity of unsawed
lumber must have been marketed in 1860 than in 1850. It
must further be admitted that the price of lumber rose considerably
between those dates, and consequently that the increase
in quantity is not to be measured by the increase in pecuniary
value. Perhaps this rise of prices may even be sufficient to
make the entire difference between the value of "sawed and
planed lumber" produced in the ten years in question by the
six New England States (21 per cent.), and the six Middle
States (15 per cent.); but the amount produced by the Western
and by the Southern States had doubled, and that returned
from the Pacific States and Territories had trebled in value in
the same interval, so that there was certainly, in those States, a
large increase in the actual quantity prepared for sale.</p>

<p>I greatly doubt whether any one of the American States,
except, perhaps, Oregon, has, at this moment, more woodland
than it ought permanently to preserve, though, no doubt, a
different distribution of the forests in all of them might be
highly advantageous. It is a great misfortune to the American
Union that the State Governments have so generally
disposed of their original domain to private citizens. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
true that public property is not sufficiently respected in the
United States; and it is also true that, within the memory of
almost every man of mature age, timber was of so little value
in that country, that the owners of private woodlands submitted,
almost without complaint, to what would be regarded
elsewhere as very aggravated trespasses upon them.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
such circumstances, it is difficult to protect the forest, whether
it belong to the state or to individuals. Property of this kind
would be subject to much plunder, as well as to frequent
damage by fire. The destruction from these causes would,
indeed, considerably lessen, but would not wholly annihilate
the climatic and geographical influences of the forest, or ruinously
diminish its value as a regular source of supply of fuel
and timber. For prevention of the evils upon which I have
so long dwelt, the American people must look to the diffusion
of general intelligence on this subject, and to the enlightened
self interest, for which they are remarkable, not to the action
of their local or general legislatures. Even in France, government
has moved with too slow and hesitating a pace, and preventive
measures do not yet compensate destructive causes.
The judicious remarks of Troy on this point may well be
applied to other countries than France, other measures of
public policy than the preservation of the woods. "To move
softly," says he, "is to commit the most dangerous, the most
unpardonable of imprudences; it diminishes the prestige of
authority; it furnishes a triumph to the sneerer and the incredulous;
it strengthens opposition and encourages resistance;
it ruins the administration in the opinion of the people,
weakens its power and depresses its courage."<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>


<h4><i>The Economy of the Forest.</i></h4>

<p>The legislation of European states upon sylviculture, and
the practice of that art, divide themselves into two great
branches&mdash;the preservation of existing forests, and the creation
of new. From the long operation of causes already set forth,
what is understood in America and other new countries by
the "primitive forest," no longer exists in the territories which
were the seats of ancient civilization and empire, except upon
a small scale, and in remote and almost inaccessible glens quite
out of the reach of ordinary observation. The oldest European
woods, indeed, are native, that is, sprung from self-sown seed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
or from the roots of trees which have been felled for human
purposes; but their growth has been controlled, in a variety
of ways, by man and by domestic animals, and they always
present more or less of an artificial character and arrangement.
Both they and planted forests, which, though certainly not
few, are of recent date in Europe, demand, as well for protection
as for promotion of growth, a treatment different in some
respects from that which would be suited to the character and
wants of the virgin wood.</p>

<p>On this latter branch of the subject, experience and observation
have not yet collected a sufficient stock of facts to serve
for the construction of a complete system of sylviculture; but
the management of the forest as it exists in France&mdash;the different
zones and climates of which country present many points
of analogy with those of the United States and some of the
British colonies&mdash;has been carefully studied, and several manuals
of practice have been prepared for the foresters of that
empire. I believe the best of these is the <i>Cours &Eacute;l&eacute;mentaire
de Culture des Bois cr&eacute;&eacute; &agrave; l'&Eacute;cole Foresti&egrave;re de Nancy, par
M. Lorentz, compl&eacute;t&eacute;, et publi&eacute; par A. Parade</i>, with a supplement
under the title of <i>Cours d'Am&eacute;nagement des For&ecirc;ts, par
Henri Nanquette</i>. The <i>&Eacute;tudes sur l'&Eacute;conomie Foresti&egrave;re, par
Jules Clav&eacute;</i>, which I have often quoted, presents a great number
of interesting views on this subject, and well deserves to
be translated for the use of the English and American reader;
but it is not designed as a practical guide, and it does not
profess to be sufficiently specific in its details to serve that
purpose. Notwithstanding the difference of conditions between
the aboriginal and the trained forest, the judicious
observer who aims at the preservation of the former will reap
much instruction from the treatises I have cited, and I believe
he will be convinced that the sooner a natural wood is brought
into the state of an artificially regulated one, the better it is
for all the multiplied interests which depend on the wise administration
of this branch of public economy.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>One consideration bearing on this subject has received less
attention than it merits, because most persons interested in
such questions have not opportunities for the comparison I
refer to. I mean the great general superiority of cultivated
timber to that of strictly spontaneous growth. I say <i>general</i>
superiority, because there are exceptions to the rule. The
white pine, <i>Pinus strobus</i>, for instance, and other trees of similar
character and uses, require, for their perfect growth, a
density of forest vegetation around them, which protects them
from too much agitation by wind, and from the persistence of
the lateral branches which fill the wood with knots. A pine
which has grown under those conditions possesses a tall,
straight stem, admirably fitted for masts and spars, and, at the
same time, its wood is almost wholly free from knots, is regular
in annular structure, soft and uniform in texture, and,
consequently, superior to almost all other timber for joinery.
If, while a large pine is spared, the broad-leaved or other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
smaller trees around it are felled, the swaying of the tree from
the action of the wind mechanically produces separations
between the layers of annual growth, and greatly diminishes
the value of the timber.</p>

<p>The same defect is often observed in pines which, from
some accident of growth, have much overtopped their fellows
in the virgin forest. The white pine, growing in the fields, or
in open glades in the woods, is totally different from the true
forest tree, both in general aspect and in quality of wood. Its
stem is much shorter, its top less tapering, its foliage denser
and more inclined to gather into tufts, its branches more
numerous and of larger diameter, its wood shows much more
distinctly the divisions of annual growth, is of coarser grain,
harder and more difficult to work into mitre joints. Intermixed
with the most valuable pines in the American forests,
are met many trees of the character I have just described.
The lumbermen call them "saplings," and generally regard
them as different in species from the true white pine, but botanists
are unable to establish a distinction between them, and
as they agree in almost all respects with trees grown in the
open grounds from known white-pine seedlings, I believe their
peculiar character is due to unfavorable circumstances in their
early growth. The pine, then, is an exception to the general
rule as to the inferiority of the forest to the open-ground tree.
The pasture oak and pasture beech, on the contrary, are well
known to produce far better timber than those grown in the
woods, and there are few trees to which the remark is not
equally applicable.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>Another advantage of the artificially regulated forest is,
that it admits of such grading of the ground as to favor the
retention or discharge of water at will, while the facilities it
affords for selecting and duly proportioning, as well as properly
spacing, the trees which compose it, are too obvious to
require to be more than hinted at. In conducting these operations,
we must have a diligent eye to the requirements of
nature, and must remember that a wood is not an arbitrary
assemblage of trees to be selected and disposed according to
the caprice of its owner. "A forest," says Clav&eacute;, "is not, as
is often supposed, a simple collection of trees succeeding each
other in long perspective, without bond of union, and capable
of isolation from each other; it is, on the contrary, a whole,
the different parts of which are interdependent upon each
other, and it constitutes, so to speak, a true individuality.
Every forest has a special character, determined by the form
of the surface it grows upon, the kinds of trees that compose
it, and the manner in which they are grouped."<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>


<h4><i>European and American Trees compared.</i></h4>

<p>The woods of North America are strikingly distinguished
from those of Europe by the vastly greater variety of species
they contain. According to Clav&eacute;, there are in "France and
in most parts of Europe" only about twenty forest trees, five
or six of which are spike-leaved and resinous, the remainder
broad-leaved."<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Our author, however, doubtless means genera,
though he uses the word <i>esp&egrave;ces</i>. Rossm&auml;ssler enumerates
fifty-seven species of forest trees as found in Germany, but
some of these are mere shrubs, some are fruit and properly
garden trees, and some others are only varieties of familiar
species. The valuable manual of Parade describes about the
same number, including, however, two of American origin&mdash;the
locust, <i>Robinia pseudacacia</i>, and the Weymouth or white
pine, <i>Pinus strobus</i>&mdash;and the cedar of Lebanon from Asia,
though it is indigenous in Algeria also. We may then safely
say that Europe does not possess above forty or fifty trees of
such economical value as to be worth the special care of the
forester, while the oak alone numbers not less than thirty
species in the United States,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> and some other North American
genera are almost equally diversified.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>
<p>Few European trees, except those bearing edible fruit, have
been naturalized in the United States, while the American
forest flora has made large contributions to that of Europe. It
is a very poor taste which has led to the substitution of the
less picturesque European for the graceful and majestic American
elm, in some public grounds in the United States. On
the other hand, the European mountain ash&mdash;which in beauty
and healthfulness of growth is superior to our own&mdash;the horse
chestnut, and the abele, or silver poplar, are valuable additions
to the ornamental trees of North America. The Swiss arve
or zirbelkiefer, <i>Pinus cembra</i>, which yields a well-flavored
edible seed and furnishes excellent wood for carving, the umbrella
pine which also bears a seed agreeable to the taste, and
which, from the color of its foliage and the beautiful form of
its dome-like crown, is among the most elegant of trees, the
white birch of Central Europe, with its pendulous branches
almost rivalling those of the weeping willow in length, flexibility,
and gracefulness of fall, and, especially, the "cypresse
funerall," might be introduced into the United States with
great advantage to the landscape. The European beech and
chestnut furnish timber of far better quality than that of their
American congeners. The fruit of the European chestnut,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
though inferior to the American in flavor, is larger, and is an
important article of diet among the French and Italian peasantry.
The walnut of Europe, though not equal to some of the
American species in beauty of growth or of wood, or to others
in strength and elasticity of fibre, is valuable for its timber and
its oil.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> The maritime pine, which has proved of such immense
use in fixing drifting sands in France, may perhaps be
better adapted to this purpose than any of the pines of the
New World, and it is of great importance for its turpentine,
resin, and tar. The &eacute;pic&eacute;a, or common fir, <i>Abies picea</i>, <i>Abies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
excelsa</i>, <i>Picea excelsa</i>, abundant in the mountains of France
and the contiguous country, is known for its product, Burgundy
pitch, and, as it flourishes in a greater variety of soil
and climate than almost any other spike-leaved tree, it might
be well worth transplantation.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> The cork oak has been introduced
into the United States, I believe, and would undoubtedly
thrive in the Southern section of the Union.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>In the walnut, the chestnut, the cork oak, the mulberry,
the olive, the orange, the lemon, the fig, and the multitude of
other trees which, by their fruit, or by other products, yield
an annual revenue, nature has provided Southern Europe with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
a partial compensation for the loss of the native forest. It is
true that these trees, planted as most of them are at such distances
as to admit of cultivation, or of the growth of grass
among them, are but an inadequate substitute for the thick
and shady wood; but they perform to a certain extent the
same offices of absorption and transpiration, they shade the
surface of the ground, they serve to break the force of the
wind, and on many a steep declivity, many a bleak and barren
hillside, the chestnut binds the soil together with its roots, and
prevents tons of earth and gravel from washing down upon
the fields and the gardens. Fruit trees are not wanting, certainly,
north of the Alps. The apple, the pear, and the prune
are important in the economy both of man and of nature, but
they are far less numerous in Switzerland and Northern
France than are the trees I have mentioned in Southern
Europe, both because they are in general less remunerative,
and because the climate, in higher latitudes, does not permit
the free introduction of shade trees into grounds occupied for
agricultural purposes.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>The multitude of species, intermixed as they are in their
spontaneous growth, gives the American forest landscape a
variety of aspect not often seen in the woods of Europe, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
the gorgeous tints, which nature repeats from the dying dolphin
to paint the falling leaf of the American maples, oaks,
and ash trees, clothe the hillsides and fringe the watercourses
with a rainbow splendor of foliage, unsurpassed by the brightest
groupings of the tropical flora. It must be admitted, however,
that both the northern and the southern declivities of
the Alps exhibit a nearer approximation to this rich and multifarious
coloring of autumnal vegetation than most American
travellers in Europe are willing to allow; and, besides, the
small deciduous shrubs which often carpet the forest glades of
these mountains are dyed with a ruddy and orange glow,
which, in the distant landscape, is no mean substitute for the
scarlet and crimson and gold and amber of the transatlantic
woodland.</p>

<p>No American evergreen known to me resembles the umbrella
pine sufficiently to be a fair object of comparison with
it.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> A cedar, very common above the Highlands on the
Hudson, is extremely like the cypress, straight, slender, with
erect, compressed ramification, and feathered to the ground,
but its foliage is neither so dark nor so dense, the tree does not
attain the majestic height of the cypress, nor has it the lithe
flexibility of that tree. In mere shape, the Lombardy poplar
nearly resembles this latter, but it is almost a profanation to
compare the two, especially when they are agitated by the
wind; for under such circumstances, the one is the most majestic,
the other the most ungraceful, or&mdash;if I may apply such
an expression to anything but human affectation of movement&mdash;the
most awkward of trees. The poplar trembles before the
blast, flutters, struggles wildly, dishevels its foliage, gropes
around with its feeble branches, and hisses as in impotent
passion. The cypress gathers its limbs still more closely to its
stem, bows a gracious salute rather than an humble obeisance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
to the tempest, bends to the wind with an elasticity that
assures you of its prompt return to its regal attitude, and sends
from its thick leaflets a murmur like the roar of the far-off
ocean.</p>

<p>The cypress and the umbrella pine are not merely conventional
types of the Italian landscape. They are essential elements
in a field of rural beauty which can be seen in perfection
only in the basin of the Mediterranean, and they are as
characteristic of this class of scenery as the date palm is of the
oases of the desert. There is, however, this difference: a single
cypress or pine is often enough to shed beauty over a wide
area; the palm is a social tree, and its beauty is not so much
that of the individual as of the group. The frequency of the
cypress and the pine&mdash;combined with the fact that the other
trees of Southern Europe which most interest a stranger from
the north, the orange and the lemon, the cork oak, the ilex,
the myrtle, and the laurel, are evergreens&mdash;goes far to explain
the beauty of the winter scenery of Italy. Indeed it is only in
the winter that a tourist who confines himself to wheel carriages
and high roads can acquire any notion of the face of the
earth, and form any proper geographical image of that country.
At other seasons, not high walls only, but equally impervious
hedges, and now, unhappily, acacias thickly planted
along the railway routes, confine the view so completely, that
the arch of a tunnel, or a night cap over the traveller's eyes,
is scarcely a more effectual obstacle to the gratification of his
curiosity.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Sylviculture.</i></h4>

<p>The art, or, as the Continental foresters call it, the science
of sylviculture has been so little pursued in England and
America, that its nomenclature has not been introduced into
the English vocabulary, and I shall not be able to describe its
processes with technical propriety of language, without occasionally
borrowing a word from the forest literature of France
and Germany. A full discussion of the methods of sylviculture
would, indeed, be out of place in a work like the present,
but the almost total want of conveniently accessible means of
information on the subject, in English-speaking countries, will
justify me in presenting it with somewhat more of detail than
would otherwise be pertinent.</p>

<p>The two best known methods are those distinguished as
the <i>taillis</i>, copse or coppice treatment,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> and the <i>futaie</i>, for which
I find no English equivalent, but which may not inappropriately
be called the <i>full-growth</i> system. A <i>taillis</i>, copse, or
coppice, is a wood composed of shoots from the roots of trees
previously cut for fuel and timber. The shoots are thinned
out from time to time, and finally cut, either after a fixed
number of years, or after the young trees have attained to certain
dimensions, their roots being then left to send out a new
progeny as before. This is the cheapest method of management,
and therefore the best wherever the price of labor and
of capital bears a high proportion to that of land and of timber;
but it is essentially a wasteful economy. If the woodland
is, in the first place, completely cut over, as is found most
convenient in practice, the young shoots have neither the shade
nor the protection from wind so important to forest growth,
and their progress is comparatively slow, while, at the same
time, the thick clumps they form choke the seedlings that may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
have sprouted near them. If domestic animals of any species
are allowed to roam in the wood, they browse upon the terminal
buds and the tender branches, thereby stunting, if they
do not kill, the young trees, and depriving them of all beauty
and vigor of growth. The evergreens, once cut, do not shoot
up again,<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> and the mixed character of the forest&mdash;in many
respects an important advantage, if not an indispensable condition
of growth&mdash;is lost;<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> and besides this, large wood of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
any species cannot be grown in this method, because trees
which shoot from decaying stumps and their dying roots,
become hollow or otherwise unsound before they acquire their
full dimensions. A more fatal objection still, is, that the roots
of trees will not bear more than two or three, or at most four
cuttings of their shoots before their vitality is exhausted, and
the wood can then be restored only by replanting entirely.
The period of cutting coppices varies in Europe from fifteen to
forty years, according to soil, species, and rapidity of growth.</p>

<p>In the <i>futaie</i>, or full-growth system, the trees are allowed
to stand as long as they continue in healthy and vigorous
growth. This is a shorter period than would be at first supposed,
when we consider the advanced age and great dimensions
to which, under favorable circumstances, many forest
trees attain in temperate climates. But, as every observing
person familiar with the natural forest is aware, these are exceptional
cases, just as are instances of great longevity or of
gigantic stature among men. Able vegetable physiologists
have maintained that the tree, like most reptiles, has no natural
limit of life or of growth, and that the only reason why
our oaks and our pines do not reach the age of twenty centuries
and the height of a hundred fathoms, is, that in the
multitude of accidents to which they are exposed, the chances
of their attaining to such a length of years and to such dimensions
of growth are a million to one against them. But
another explanation of this fact is possible. In trees affected
by no discoverable external cause of death, decay begins at the
topmost branches, which seem to wither and die for want of
nutriment. The mysterious force by which the sap is carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
from the roots to the utmost twigs, cannot be conceived to be
unlimited in power, and it is probable that it differs in different
species, so that while it may suffice to raise the fluid to
the height of five hundred feet in the sequoia, it may not be
able to carry it beyond one hundred and fifty in the oak. The
limit may be different, too, in different trees of the same species,
not from defective organization in those of inferior
growth, but from more or less favorable conditions of soil,
nourishment, and exposure. Whenever a tree attains to the
limit beyond which its circulating fluids cannot rise, we may
suppose that decay begins, and death follows, from the same
causes which bring about the same results in animals of limited
size&mdash;such, for example, as the interruption of functions
essential to life, in consequence of the clogging up of ducts by
matter assimilable in the stage of growth, but no longer so
when increment has ceased.</p>

<p>In the natural woods, we observe that, though, among the
myriads of trees which grow upon a square mile, there are
several vegetable giants, yet the great majority of them begin
to decay long before they have attained their maximum of
stature, and this seems to be still more emphatically true of
the artificial forest. In France, according to Clav&eacute;, "oaks, in
a suitable soil, may stand, without exhibiting any sign of
decay, for two or three hundred years; the pines hardly exceed
one hundred and twenty, and the soft or white woods
[<i>bois blancs</i>], in wet soils, languish and die before reaching the
fiftieth year."<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> These ages are certainly below the average of
those of American forest trees, and are greatly exceeded in
very numerous well-attested instances of isolated trees in
Europe.</p>

<p>The former mode of treating the futaie, called the garden
system, was to cut the trees individually as they arrived at
maturity, but, in the best regulated forests, this practice has
been abandoned for the German method, which embraces not
only the securing of the largest immediate profit, but the re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>planting
of the forest, and the care of the young growth. This
is effected in the case of a forest, whether natural or artificial,
which is to be subjected to regular management, by three
operations. The first of these consists in felling about one
third of the wood, in such way as to leave convenient spaces
for the growth of young trees. The remaining two-thirds are
relied upon to replant the vacancies, by natural sowing, which
they seldom or never fail to do. The seedlings are watched,
are thinned out when too dense, the ill formed and sickly, as
well as those of inferior value, and the shrubs and thorns
which might otherwise choke or too closely shade them, are
pulled up. When they have attained sufficient strength and
development of foliage to bear or to require more light and
air, the second step is taken, by removing a suitable proportion
of the old trees which had been spared at the first cutting;
and when, finally, they are hardened enough to bear frost and
sun without other protection than that which they mutually
give to each other, the remainder of the original forest is felled,
and the wood now consists wholly of young and vigorous trees.
This result is obtained after about twenty years. At convenient
periods afterward, the unhealthy stocks and those
injured by wind or other accidents are removed, and in some
instances the growth of the remainder is promoted by irrigation
or by fertilizing applications.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> When the forest is ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>proaching
to maturity, the original processes already described
are repeated; and as, in different parts of an extensive forest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
they would take place in different zones, it would afford indefinitely
an annual crop of firewood and timber.</p>

<p>The duties of the forester do not end here. It sometimes
happens that the glades left by felling the older trees are not
sufficiently seeded, or that the species, or <i>essences</i>, as the
French oddly call them, are not duly proportioned in the new
crop. In this case, seed must be artificially sown, or young
trees planted in the vacancies.</p>

<p>One of the most important rules in the administration of
the forest is the absolute exclusion of domestic quadrupeds
from every wood which is not destined to be cleared. No
growth of young trees is possible where cattle are admitted to
pasture at any season of the year, though they are undoubtedly
most destructive while trees are in leaf.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>It is often necessary to take measures for the protection of
young trees against the rabbit, the mole, and other rodent
quadrupeds, and of older ones against the damage done by the
larv&aelig; of insects hatched upon the surface or in the tissues of
the bark, or even in the wood itself. The much greater liability
of the artificial than of the natural forest to injury from
this cause is perhaps the only point in which the superiority
of the former to the latter is not as marked as that of any
domesticated vegetable to its wild representative. But the
better quality of the wood and the much more rapid growth
of the trained and regulated forest are abundant compensations
for the loss thus occasioned, and the progress of entomological
science will, perhaps, suggest new methods of preventing
the ravages of insects. Thus far, however, the collection
and destruction of the eggs, by simple but expensive means,
has proved the only effectual remedy.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>It is common in Europe to permit the removal of the fallen
leaves and fragments of bark and branches with which the
forest soil is covered, and sometimes the cutting of the lower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
twigs of evergreens. The leaves and twigs are principally
used as litter for cattle, and finally as manure, the bark and
wind-fallen branches as fuel. By long usage, sometimes by
express grant, this privilege has become a vested right of the
population in the neighborhood of many public, and even
large private forests; but it is generally regarded as a serious
evil. To remove the leaves and fallen twigs is to withdraw
much of the pabulum upon which the tree was destined to
feed. The small branches and leaves are the parts of the tree
which yield the largest proportion of ashes on combustion, and
of course they supply a great amount of nutriment for the
young shoots. "A cubic foot of twigs," says Vaupell, "yields
four times as much ashes as a cubic foot of stem wood. * *
For every hundred weight of dried leaves carried off from a
beech forest, we sacrifice a hundred and sixty cubic feet of
wood. The leaves and the mosses are a substitute, not only
for manure, but for ploughing. The carbonic acid given out
by decaying leaves, when taken up by water, serves to dissolve
the mineral constituents of the soil, and is particularly active
in disintegrating feldspar and the clay derived from its decomposition.
* * * The leaves belong to the soil. Without
them it cannot preserve its fertility, and cannot furnish nutriment
to the beech. The trees languish, produce seed incapable
of germination, and the spontaneous self-sowing, which
is an indispensable element in the best systems of sylviculture,
fails altogether in the bared and impoverished soil."<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides these evils, the removal of the leaves deprives the
soil of that spongy character which gives it such immense
value as a reservoir of moisture and a regulator of the flow of
springs; and, finally, it exposes the surface roots to the drying
influence of sun and wind, to accidental mechanical injury
from the tread of animals or men, and, in cold climates, to the
destructive effects of frost.</p>

<p>The annual lopping and trimming of trees for fuel, so common
in Europe, is fatal to the higher uses of the forest, but
where small groves are made, or rows of trees planted, for no
other purpose than to secure a supply of firewood, or to serve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
as supports for the vine, it is often very advantageous. The
willows, and many other trees, bear polling for a long series
of years without apparent diminution of growth of branches,
and though certainly a polled, or, to use an old English word,
a doddered tree, is in general a melancholy object, yet it must
be admitted that the aspect of some species&mdash;the American
locust, <i>Robinia pseudacacia</i>, for instance&mdash;when young, is
improved by this process.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>I have spoken of the needs of agriculture as a principal
cause of the destruction of the forest, and of domestic cattle as
particularly injurious to the growth of young trees. But these
animals affect the forest, indirectly, in a still more important
way, because the extent of cleared ground required for agricultural
use depends very much on the number and kinds of
the cattle bred. We have seen, in a former chapter, that, in
the United States, the domestic quadrupeds amount to more
than a hundred millions, or three times the number of the
human population of the Union. In many of the Western
States, the swine subsist more or less on acorns, nuts, and
other products of the woods, and the prairies, or natural meadows
of the Mississippi valley, yield a large amount of food for
beast, as well as for man. With these exceptions, all this vast
army of quadrupeds is fed wholly on grass, grain, pulse, and
roots grown on soil reclaimed from the forest by European
settlers. It is true that the flesh of domestic quadrupeds
enters very largely into the aliment of the American people,
and greatly reduces the quantity of vegetable nutriment which
they would otherwise consume, so that a smaller amount of
agricultural product is required for immediate human food,
and, of course, a smaller extent of cleared land is needed for
the growth of that product, than if no domestic animals existed.
But the flesh of the horse, the ass, and the mule is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
consumed by man, and the sheep is reared rather for its fleece
than for food. Besides this, the ground required to produce
the grass and grain consumed in rearing and fattening a grazing
quadruped, would yield a far larger amount of nutriment,
if devoted to the growing of breadstuffs, than is furnished by
his flesh; and, upon the whole, whatever advantages may be
reaped from the breeding of domestic cattle, it is plain that
the cleared land devoted to their sustenance in the originally
wooded part of the United States, after deducting a quantity
sufficient to produce an amount of aliment equal to their flesh,
still greatly exceeds that cultivated for vegetables, directly
consumed by the people of the same regions; or, to express a
nearly equivalent idea in other words, the meadow and the
pasture, taken together, much exceed the plough land.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>In fertile countries, like the United States, the foreign
demand for animal and vegetable aliment, for cotton, and for
tobacco, much enlarges the sphere of agricultural operations,
and, of course, prompts further encroachments upon the forest.
The commerce in these articles, therefore, constitutes in America
a special cause of the destruction of the woods, which does
not exist in the numerous states of the Old World that derive
the raw material of their mechanical industry from distant
lands, and import many articles of vegetable food or luxury
which their own climates cannot advantageously produce.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>The growth of arboreal vegetation is so slow that, though
he who buries an acorn may hope to see it shoot up to a miniature
resemblance of the majestic tree which shall shade his
remote descendants, yet the longest life hardly embraces the
seedtime and the harvest of a forest. The planter of a wood
must be actuated by higher motives than those of an investment
the profits of which consist in direct pecuniary gain to
himself or even to his posterity; for if, in rare cases, an artificial
forest may, in two or three generations, more than repay
its original cost, still, in general, the value of its timber will not
return the capital expended and the interest accrued.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> But
when we consider the immense collateral advantages derived
from the presence, the terrible evils necessarily resulting from
the destruction of the forest, both the preservation of existing
woods, and the far more costly extension of them where they
have been unduly reduced, are among the most obvious of the
duties which this age owes to those that are to come after it.
Especially is this obligation incumbent upon Americans. No
civilized people profits so largely from the toils and sacrifices
of its immediate predecessors as they; no generations have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
ever sown so liberally, and, in their own persons, reaped so
scanty a return, as the pioneers of Anglo-American social life.
We can repay our debt to our noble forefathers only by a like
magnanimity, by a like self-forgetting care for the moral and
material interests of our own posterity.</p>


<h4><i>Instability of American Life.</i></h4>

<p>All human institutions, associate arrangements, modes of
life, have their characteristic imperfections. The natural, perhaps
the necessary defect of ours, is their instability, their
want of fixedness, not in form only, but even in spirit. The
face of physical nature in the United States shares this incessant
fluctuation, and the landscape is as variable as the habits
of the population. It is time for some abatement in the restless
love of change which characterizes us, and makes us almost
a nomade rather than a sedentary people.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> We have now
felled forest enough everywhere, in many districts far too much.
Let us restore this one element of material life to its normal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
proportions, and devise means for maintaining the permanence
of its relations to the fields, the meadows, and the pastures, to
the rain and the dews of heaven, to the springs and rivulets
with which it waters the earth. The establishment of an approximately
fixed ratio between the two most broadly characterized
distinctions of rural surface&mdash;woodland and plough land&mdash;would
involve a certain persistence of character in all the
branches of industry, all the occupations and habits of life,
which depend upon or are immediately connected with either,
without implying a rigidity that should exclude flexibility of
accommodation to the many changes of external circumstance
which human wisdom can neither prevent nor foresee, and
would thus help us to become, more emphatically, a well-ordered
and stable commonwealth, and, not less conspicuously,
a people of progress.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note</span> on word <i>watershed</i>, omitted on p. 257.&mdash;Sir John F. W. Herschel
(<i>Physical Geography</i>, 137, and elsewhere) spells this word <i>water-sched</i>, because
he considers it a translation, or rather an adoption of the German
"Wasser-scheide, separation of the waters, not water-<i>shed</i>, the slope <i>down
which</i> the waters run," As a point of historical etymology, it is probable
that the word in question was suggested to those who first used it by the
German <i>Wasserscheide</i>; but the spelling <i>water-sched</i>, proposed by Herschel,
is objectionable, both because <i>sch</i> is a combination of letters wholly unknown
to modern English orthography and properly representing no sound
recognized in English orthoepy, and for the still better reason that <i>watershed</i>,
in the sense of <i>division-of-the-waters</i>, has a legitimate English etymology.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon <i>sceadan</i> meant both to separate or divide, and to shade
or shelter. It is the root of the English verbs <i>to shed</i> and <i>to shade</i>, and in
the former meaning is the A. S. equivalent of the German verb <i>scheiden</i>.</p>

<p><i>Shed</i> in Old English had the meaning <i>to separate</i> or <i>distinguish</i>. It is
so used in the <i>Owl and the Nightingale</i>, v. 197. Palsgrave (<i>Lesclarcissement,
etc.</i>, p. 717) defines <i>I shede</i>, I departe thinges asonder; and the word
still means <i>to divide</i> in several English local dialects. Hence, <i>watershed</i>,
the division or separation of the waters, is good English both in sense and
spelling.</p></div>

<h4><i>Land artificially won from the Waters.</i></h4>

<p>Man, as we have seen, has done much to revolutionize the
solid surface of the globe, and to change the distribution and
proportions, if not the essential character, of the organisms
which inhabit the land and even the waters. Besides the influence
thus exerted upon the life which peoples the sea, his
action upon the land has involved a certain amount of indirect
encroachment upon the territorial jurisdiction of the ocean.
So far as he has increased the erosion of running waters by the
destruction of the forest, he has promoted the deposit of solid
matter in the sea, thus reducing its depth, advancing the coast
line, and diminishing the area covered by the waters. He has
gone beyond this, and invaded the realm of the ocean by con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>structing
within its borders wharves, piers, lighthouses, breakwaters,
fortresses, and other facilities for his commercial and
military operations; and in some countries he has permanently
rescued from tidal overflow, and even from the very bed of
the deep, tracts of ground extensive enough to constitute valuable
additions to his agricultural domain. The quantity of
soil gained from the sea by these different modes of acquisition
is, indeed, too inconsiderable to form an appreciable element
in the comparison of the general proportion between the two
great forms of terrestrial surface, land and water; but the
results of such operations, considered in their physical and
their moral bearings, are sufficiently important to entitle them
to special notice in every comprehensive view of the relations
between man and nature.</p>

<p>There are cases, as on the western shores of the Baltic,
where, in consequence of the secular elevation of the coast, the
sea appears to be retiring; others, where, from the slow sinking
of the land, it seems to be advancing. These movements
depend upon geological causes wholly out of our reach, and
man can neither advance nor retard them. There are also
cases where similar apparent effects are produced by local
oceanic currents, by river deposit or erosion, by tidal action, or
by the influence of the wind upon the waves and the sands of
the sea beach. A regular current may drift suspended earth
and seaweed along a coast until they are caught by an eddy
and finally deposited out of the reach of further disturbance,
or it may scoop out the bed of the sea and undermine promontories
and headlands; a powerful river, as the wind changes
the direction of its flow at its outlet, may wash away shores
and sandbanks at one point to deposit their material at another;
the tide or waves, stirred to unusual depths by the
wind, may gradually wear down the line of coast, or they
may form shoals and coast dunes by depositing the sand they
have rolled up from the bottom of the ocean. These latter
modes of action are slow in producing effects sufficiently important
to be noticed in general geography, or even to be
visible in the representations of coast line laid down in ordi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>nary
maps; but they nevertheless form conspicuous features
in local topography, and they are attended with consequences
of great moment to the material and the moral interests of
men.</p>

<p>The forces which produce these results are all in a considerable
degree subject to control, or rather to direction and
resistance, by human power, and it is in guiding and combating
them that man has achieved some of his most remarkable
and honorable conquests over nature. The triumphs in question,
or what we generally call harbor and coast improvements,
whether we estimate their value by the money and
labor expended upon them, or by their bearing upon the interests
of commerce and the arts of civilization, must take a very
high rank among the great works of man, and they are fast
assuming a magnitude greatly exceeding their former relative
importance. The extension of commerce and of the military
marine, and especially the introduction of vessels of increased
burden and deeper draught of water, have imposed upon engineers
tasks of a character which a century ago would have
been pronounced, and, in fact, would have been impracticable;
but necessity has stimulated an ingenuity which has contrived
means of executing them, and which gives promise of yet
greater performance in time to come.</p>

<p>Men have ceased to admire the power which heaped up the
great pyramid to gratify the pride of a despot with a giant
sepulchre; for many great harbors, many important lines of
internal communication, in the civilized world, now exhibit
works which surpass the vastest remains of ancient architectural
art in mass and weight of matter, demand the exercise
of far greater constructive skill, and involve a much heavier
pecuniary expenditure than would now be required for the
building of the tomb of Cheops. It is computed that the great
pyramid, the solid contents of which when complete were about
3,000,000 cubic yards, could be erected for a million of pounds
sterling. The breakwater at Cherbourg, founded in rough water
sixty feet, deep, at an average distance of more than two miles
from the shore, contains double the mass of the pyramid, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
many a comparatively unimportant railroad has been constructed
at twice the cost which would now build that stupendous
monument. Indeed, although man, detached from the
solid earth, is almost powerless to struggle against the sea, he
is fast becoming invincible by it so long as his foot is planted
on the shore, or even on the bottom of the rolling ocean; and
though on some battle fields between the waters and the land,
he is obliged slowly to yield his ground, yet he retreats still
facing the foe, and will finally be able to say to the sea:
"Thus far shalt thou come and no farther, and here shall thy
proud waves be stayed!"</p>

<p>The description of works of harbor and coast improvement
which have only an economical value, not a true geographical
importance, does not come within the plan of the present
volume, and in treating this branch of my subject, I shall
confine myself to such as are designed either to gain new soil
by excluding the waters from grounds which they had permanently
or occasionally covered, or to resist new encroachments
of the sea upon the land.</p>


<h4>a. <i>Exclusion of the Sea by Diking.</i></h4>

<p>The draining of the Lincolnshire fens in England, which
converted about 400,000 acres of marsh, pool, and tide-washed
flat into plough land and pasturage, is a work, or rather series
of works, of great magnitude, and it possesses much economical,
and, indeed, no trifling geographical importance. Its
plans and methods were, at least in part, borrowed from the
example of like improvements in Holland, and it is, in difficulty
and extent, inferior to works executed for the same purpose
on the opposite coast of the North Sea, by Dutch, Frisic,
and Low German engineers. The space I can devote to such
operations will be better employed in describing the latter,
and I content myself with the simple statement I have already
made of the quantity of worthless and even pestilential land
which has been rendered both productive and salubrious in
Lincolnshire, by diking out the sea, and the rivers which traverse
the fens of that country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>The almost continued prevalence of west winds upon both
coasts of the German Ocean occasions a constant set of the
currents of that sea to the east, and both for this reason and
on account of the greater violence of storms from the former
quarter, the English shores are much less exposed to invasion
by the waves than those of the Netherlands and the provinces
contiguous to them on the north. The old Netherlandish
chronicles are filled with the most startling accounts of the
damage done by the irruptions of the ocean, from west winds
or extraordinarily high tides, at times long before any considerable
extent of seacoast was diked. Several hundreds of these
terrible inundations are recorded, and in very many of them
the loss of human lives is estimated as high as one hundred
thousand. It is impossible to doubt that there must be enormous
exaggeration in these numbers; for, with all the reckless
hardihood shown by men in braving the dangers and privations
attached by nature to their birthplace, it is inconceivable
that so dense a population as such wholesale destruction of life
supposes could find the means of subsistence, or content itself
to dwell, on a territory liable, a dozen times in a century, to
such fearful devastation. There can be no doubt, however,
that the low continental shores of the German Ocean very frequently
suffered immense injury from inundation by the sea,
and it is natural, therefore, that the various arts of resistance
to the encroachments of the ocean, and, finally, of aggressive
warfare upon its domain, and of permanent conquest of its
territory, should have been earlier studied and carried to
higher perfection in the latter countries, than in England,
which had much less to lose or to gain by the incursions or the
retreat of the waters.</p>

<p>Indeed, although the confinement of swelling rivers by
artificial embankments is of great antiquity, I do not know
that the defence or acquisition of land from the sea by diking
was ever practised on a large scale until systematically undertaken
by the Netherlanders, a few centuries after the commencement
of the Christian era. The silence of the Roman
historians affords a strong presumption that this art was un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>known
to the inhabitants of the Netherlands at the time of the
Roman invasion, and the elder Pliny's description of the mode
of life along the coast which has now been long diked in,
applies precisely to the habits of the people who live on the
low islands and mainland flats lying outside of the chain of
dikes, and wholly unprotected by embankments of any sort.</p>

<p>It has been conjectured, and not without probability, that
the causeways built by the Romans across the marshes of the
Low Countries, in their campaigns against the Germanic tribes,
gave the natives the first hint of the utility which might be
derived from similar constructions applied to a different purpose.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
If this is so, it is one of the most interesting among
the many instances in which the arts and enginery of war have
been so modified as to be eminently promotive of the blessings
of peace, thereby in some measure compensating the wrongs
and sufferings they have inflicted on humanity.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> The Low<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>landers
are believed to have secured some coast and bay islands
by ring dikes, and to have embanked some fresh water channels,
as early as the eighth or ninth century; but it does not
appear that sea dikes, important enough to be noticed in historical
records, were constructed on the mainland before the thirteenth
century. The practice of draining inland accumulation
of water, whether fresh or salt, for the purpose of bringing
under cultivation the ground they cover, is of later origin, and
is said not to have been adopted until after the middle of the
fifteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>The total amount of surface gained to the agriculture of
the Netherlands by diking out the sea and by draining shallow
bays and lakes, is estimated by Staring at three hundred and
fifty-five thousand <i>bunder</i> or hectares, equal to eight hundred
and seventy-seven thousand two hundred and forty acres,
which is one tenth of the area of the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> In very many
instances, the dikes have been partially, in some particularly
exposed localities totally destroyed by the violence of the sea,
and the drained lands again flooded. In some cases, the soil
thus painfully won from the ocean has been entirely lost; in
others it has been recovered by repairing or rebuilding the
dikes and pumping out the water. Besides this, the weight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
of the dikes gradually sinks them into the soft soil beneath,
and this loss of elevation must be compensated by raising the
surface, while the increased burden thus added tends to sink
them still lower. "Tetens declares," says Kohl, "that in some
places the dikes have gradually sunk to the depth of sixty or
even a hundred feet."<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> For these reasons, the processes of
dike building have been almost everywhere again and again
repeated, and thus the total expenditure of money and of labor
upon the works in question is much greater than would appear
from an estimate of the actual cost of diking-in a given extent
of coast land and draining a given area of water surface.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, by erosion of the coast line, the drifting
of sand dunes into the interior, and the drowning of fens and
morasses by incursions of the sea&mdash;all caused, or at least
greatly aggravated, by human improvidence&mdash;the Netherlands
have lost a far larger area of land since the commencement of
the Christian era than they have gained by diking and draining.
Staring despairs of the possibility of calculating the loss
from the first-mentioned two causes of destruction, but he esti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>mates
that not less than six hundred and forty thousand bunder,
or one million five hundred and eighty-one thousand
acres, of fen and marsh have been washed away, or rather
deprived of their vegetable surface and covered by water, and
thirty-seven thousand bunder, or ninety-one thousand four
hundred acres of recovered land, have been lost by the destruction
of the dikes which protected them.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> The average value
of land gained from the sea is estimated at about nineteen
pounds sterling, or ninety dollars, per acre; while the lost
fen and morass was not worth more than one twenty-fifth
part of the same price. The ground buried by the drifting of
the dunes appears to have been almost entirely of this latter
character, and, upon the whole, there is no doubt that the soil
added by human industry to the territory of the Netherlands,
within the historical period, greatly exceeds in pecuniary value
that which has fallen a prey to the waves during the same era.</p>

<p>Upon most low and shelving coasts, like those of the Netherlands,
the maritime currents are constantly changing, in
consequence of the variability of the winds, and the shifting
of the sandbanks, which the currents themselves now form and
now displace. While, therefore, at one point the sea is advancing
landward, and requiring great effort to prevent the
undermining and washing away of the dikes, it is shoaling at
another by its own deposits, and exposing, at low water, a
gradually widening belt of sands and ooze. The coast lands
selected for diking-in are always at points where the sea is
depositing productive soil. The Eider, the Elbe, the Weser,
the Ems, the Rhine, the Maas, and the Schelde bring down
large quantities of fine earth. The prevalence of west winds
prevents the waters from carrying this material far out from
the coast, and it is at last deposited northward or southward
from the mouth of the rivers which contribute it, according to
the varying drift of the currents.</p>

<p>The process of natural deposit which prepares the coast for
diking-in is thus described by Staring: "All sea-deposited soil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
is composed of the same constituents. First comes a stratum
of sand, with marine shells, or the shells of mollusks living in
brackish water. If there be tides, and, of course, flowing and
ebbing currents, mud is let fall upon the sand only after the
latter has been raised above low-water mark; for then only,
at the change from flood to ebb, is the water still enough to
form a deposit of so light a material. Where mud is found at
greater depths, as, for example, in a large proportion of the Ij,
it is a proof that at this point there was never any considerable
tidal flow or other current. * * * The powerful
tidal currents, flowing and ebbing twice a day, drift sand with
them. They scoop out the bottom at one point, raise it at
another, and the sandbanks in the current are continually
shifting. As soon as a bank raises itself above low-water
mark, flags and reeds establish themselves upon it. The mechanical
resistance of these plants checks the retreat of the
high water and favors the deposit of the earth suspended in it,
and the formation of land goes on with surprising rapidity.
When it has risen to high-water level, it is soon covered with
grasses, and becomes what is called <i>schor</i> in Zeeland, <i>kwelder</i>
in Friesland. Such grounds are the foundation or starting
point of the process of diking. When they are once elevated
to the flood-tide level, no more mud is deposited upon them
except by extraordinary high tides. Their further rise is,
accordingly, very slow, and it is seldom advantageous to delay
longer the operation of diking."<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>The formation of new banks by the sea is constantly going
on at points favorable for the deposit of sand and earth, and
hence opportunity is continually afforded for enclosure of new
land outside of that already diked in, the coast is fast advancing
seaward, and every new embankment increases the security
of former enclosures. The province of Zeeland consists
of islands washed by the sea on their western coasts, and separated
by the many channels through which the Schelde and
some other rivers find their way to the ocean. In the twelfth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
century these islands were much smaller and more numerous
than at present. They have been gradually enlarged, and, in
several instances, at last connected by the extension of their
system of dikes. Walcheren is formed of ten islets united into
one about the end of the fourteenth century. At the middle
of the fifteenth century, Goeree and Overflakkee consisted of
separate islands, containing altogether about ten thousand
acres; by means of above sixty successive advances of the
dikes, they have been brought to compose a single island,
whose area is not less than sixty thousand acres.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>In the Netherlands&mdash;which the first Napoleon characterized
as a deposit of the Rhine, and as, therefore, by natural
law, rightfully the property of him who controlled the sources
of that great river&mdash;and on the adjacent Frisic, Low German
and Danish shores and islands, sea and river dikes have been
constructed on a grander and more imposing scale than in any
other country. The whole economy of the art has been there
most thoroughly studied, and the literature of the subject is
very extensive. For my present aim, which is concerned with
results rather than with processes, it is not worth while to refer
to professional treatises, and I shall content myself with presenting
such information as can be gathered from works of a
more popular character.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>The superior strata of the lowlands upon and near the
coast are, as we have seen, principally composed of soil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
brought down by the great rivers I have mentioned, and
either directly deposited by them upon the sands of the bottom,
or carried out to sea by their currents, and then, after a
shorter or longer exposure to the chemical and mechanical
action of salt water and marine currents, restored again to the
land by tidal overflow and subsidence from the waters in
which it was suspended. At a very remote period, the coast
flats were, at many points, raised so high by successive alluvious
or tidal deposits as to be above ordinary high water
level, but they were still liable to occasional inundation from
river floods, and from the sea water also, when heavy or long-continued
west winds drove it landward. The extraordinary
fertility of this soil and its security as a retreat from hostile
violence attracted to it a considerable population, while its
want of protection against inundation exposed it to the devastations
of which the chroniclers of the Middle Ages have left
such highly colored pictures. The first permanent dwellings
on the coast flats were erected upon artificial mounds, and
many similar precarious habitations still exist on the unwalled
islands and shores beyond the chain of dikes. River embankments,
which, as is familiarly known, have from the earliest
antiquity been employed in many countries where sea dikes
are unknown, were probably the first works of this character
constructed in the Low Countries, and when two neighboring
streams of fresh water had been embanked, the next step in
the process would naturally be to connect the river walls
together by a transverse dike or raised causeway, which would
serve to secure the intermediate ground both against the backwater
of river floods and against overflow by the sea. The
oldest true sea dikes described in historical records, however,
are those enclosing islands in the estuaries of the great rivers,
and it is not impossible that the double character they possess
as a security against maritime floods and as a military rampart,
led to their adoption upon those islands before similar
constructions had been attempted upon the mainland.</p>

<p>At some points of the coast, various contrivances, such as
piers, piles, and, in fact, obstructions of all sorts to the ebb of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
the current, are employed to facilitate the deposit of slime,
before a regular enclosure is commenced. Usually, however,
the first step is to build low and cheap embankments, extending
from an older dike, or from high ground, around the
parcel of flat intended to be secured. These are called summer
dikes (<i>sommer-deich</i>, pl. <i>sommer-deiche</i>, German; <i>zomerkaai</i>,
<i>zomerkade</i>, pl. <i>zomerkaaie</i>, <i>zomerkaden</i>, Dutch). They are
erected when a sufficient extent of ground to repay the cost
has been elevated enough to be covered with coarse vegetation
fit for pasturage. They serve both to secure the ground from
overflow by the ordinary flood tides of mild weather, and to
retain the slime deposited by very high water, which would
otherwise be partly carried off by the retreating ebb. The
elevation of the soil goes on slowly after this; but when it has
at last been sufficiently enriched, and raised high enough to
justify the necessary outlay, permanent dikes are constructed
by which the water is excluded at all seasons. These embankments
are constructed of sand from the coast dunes or from
sandbanks, and of earth from the mainland or from flats outside
the dikes, bound and strengthened by fascines, and provided
with sluices, which are generally founded on piles and
of very expensive construction, for drainage at low water.
The outward slope of the sea dikes is gentle, experience having
shown that this form is least exposed to injury both from the
waves and from floating ice, and the most modern dikes are
even more moderate in the inclination of the seaward scarp
than the older ones.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> The crown of the dike, however, for the
last three or four feet of its height, is much steeper, being
intended rather as a protection against the spray than against
the waves, and the inner slope is always comparatively abrupt.</p>

<p>The height and thickness of dikes varies according to the
elevation of the ground they enclose, the rise of the tides, the
direction of the prevailing winds, and other special causes of
exposure, but it may be said that they are, in general, raised
from fifteen to twenty feet above ordinary high-water mark.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
The water slopes of river dikes are protected by plantations of
willows or strong semi-aquatic shrubs or grasses, but as these
will not grow upon banks exposed to salt water, sea dikes
must be faced with stone, fascines, or some other <i>rev&ecirc;tement</i>.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
Upon the coast of Schleswig and Holstein, where the people
have less capital at their command, they defend their embankments
against ice and the waves by a coating of twisted straw
or reeds, which must be renewed as often as once, sometimes
twice a year. The inhabitants of these coasts call the chain of
dikes "the golden border," a name it well deserves, whether
we suppose it to refer to its enormous cost, or, as is more
probable, to its immense value as a protection to their fields
and their firesides.</p>

<p>When outlying flats are enclosed by building new embankments,
the old interior dikes are suffered to remain, both as an
additional security against the waves, and because the removal
of them would be expensive. They serve, also, as roads or
causeways, a purpose for which the embankments nearest the
sea are seldom employed, because the whole structure might
be endangered from the breaking of the turf by wheels and
the hoofs of horses. Where successive rows of dikes have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
thus constructed, it is observed that the ground defended by
the more ancient embankments is lower than that embraced
within the newer enclosures, and this depression of level has
been ascribed to a general subsidence of the coast from geological
causes; but the better opinion seems to be that it is, in
most cases, due merely to the consolidation and settling of the
earth from being more effectually dried, from the weight of
the dikes, from the tread of men and cattle, and from the
movement of the heavy wagons which carry off the crops.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
Notwithstanding this slow sinking, most of the land enclosed
by dikes is still above low-water mark, and can, therefore, be
wholly or partially freed from rain water, and from that received
by infiltration from higher ground, by sluices opened
at the ebb of the tide. For this purpose, the land is carefully
ditched, and advantage is taken of every favorable occasion for
discharging the water through the sluices. But the ground
cannot be effectually drained by this means, unless it is elevated
four or five feet, at least, above the level of the ebb tide,
because the ditches would not otherwise have a sufficient
descent to carry the water off in the short interval between
ebb and flow, and because the moisture of the saturated subsoil
is always rising by capillary attraction. Whenever, therefore,
the soil has sunk below the level I have mentioned, and
in cases where its surface has never been raised above it,
pumps, worked by wind or some other mechanical power,
must be very frequently employed to keep the land dry
enough for pasturage and cultivation.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<h4>b. <i>Draining of Lakes and Marshes.</i></h4>

<p>The substitution of steam engines for the feeble and uncertain
action of windmills, in driving pumps, has much facilitated
the removal of water from the polders and the draining
of lakes, marshes, and shallow bays, and thus given such an
impulse to these enterprises, that not less than one hundred
and ten thousand acres were reclaimed from the waters, and
added to the agricultural domain of the Netherlands, between
1815 and 1858. The most important of these undertakings
was the draining of the Lake of Haarlem, and for this purpose
some of the most powerful hydraulic engines ever constructed
were designed and executed.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> The origin of this lake is unknown.
It is supposed by some geographers to be a part of
an ancient bed of the Rhine, the channel of which, as there is
good reason to believe, has undergone great changes since the
Roman invasion of the Netherlands; by others it is thought
to have once formed an inland marine channel, separated from
the sea by a chain of low islands, which the sand washed up
by the tides has since connected with the mainland and converted
into a continuous line of coast. The best authorities,
however, find geological evidence that the surface occupied by
the lake was originally a marshy tract containing within its
limits little solid ground, but many ponds and inlets, and
much floating as well as fixed fen.</p>

<p>In consequence of the cutting of turf for fuel, and the de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>struction
of the few trees and shrubs which held the loose soil
together with their roots, the ponds are supposed to have gradually
extended themselves, until the action of the wind upon
their enlarged surface gave their waves sufficient force to overcome
the resistance of the feeble barriers which separated
them, and to unite them all into a single lake. Popular tradition,
it is true, ascribes the formation of the Lake of Haarlem
to a single irruption of the sea, at a remote period, and connects
it with one or another of the destructive inundations of
which the Netherland chronicles describe so many; but on a
map of the year 1531, a chain of four smaller waters occupies
nearly the ground afterward covered by the Lake of Haarlem,
and they have more probably been united by gradual encroachments
resulting from the improvident practices above
referred to, though no doubt the consummation may have
been hastened by floods, and by the neglect to maintain dikes,
or the intentional destruction of them, in the long wars of the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The Lake of Haarlem was a body of water not far from
fifteen miles in length, by seven in greatest width, lying between
the cities of Amsterdam and Leyden, running parallel
with the coast of Holland at the distance of about five miles
from the sea, and covering an area of about 45,000 acres. By
means of the Ij, it communicated with the Zuiderzee, the
Mediterranean of the Netherlands, and its surface was little
above the mean elevation of that of the sea. Whenever, therefore,
the waters of the Zuiderzee were acted upon by strong
northwest winds, those of the Lake of Haarlem were raised proportionally
and driven southward, while winds from the south
tended to create a flow in the opposite direction. The shores
of the lake were everywhere low, and though in the course of
the eighty years between 1767 and 1848 more than &pound;350,000
or $1,700,000 had been expended in checking its encroachments,
it often burst its barriers, and produced destructive
inundations. On the 29th of November, 1836, a south wind
brought its waters to the very gates of Amsterdam, and on the
26th of December of the same year, in a northwest gale, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
overflowed twenty thousand acres of land at the southern extremity
of the lake, and flooded a part of the city of Leyden.
The depth of water did not, in general, exceed fourteen feet,
but the bottom was a semi-fluid ooze or slime, which partook
of the agitation of the waves, and added considerably to their
mechanical force. Serious fears were entertained that the lake
would form a junction with the inland waters of the Legmeer
and Mijdrecht, swallow up a vast extent of valuable soil, and
finally endanger the security of a large proportion of the land
which the industry of Holland had gained in the course of
centuries from the ocean.</p>

<p>For this reason, and for the sake of the large addition the
bottom of the lake would make to the cultivable soil of the
state, it was resolved to drain it, and the preliminary steps for
that purpose were commenced in the year 1840. The first
operation was to surround the entire lake with a ring canal
and dike, in order to cut off the communication with the Ij, and
to exclude the water of the streams and morasses which discharged
themselves into it from the land side. The dike was
composed of different materials, according to the means of supply
at different points, such as sand from the coast dunes, earth
and turf excavated from the line of the ring canal, and floating
turf,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> fascines being everywhere used to bind and compact the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
mass together. This operation was completed in 1848, and
three steam pumps were then employed for five years in discharging
the water. The whole enterprise was conducted at
the expense of the state, and in 1853 the recovered lands were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
offered for sale for its benefit. Up to 1858, forty-two thousand
acres had been sold at not far from sixteen pounds sterling
or seventy-seven dollars an acre, amounting altogether to
&pound;661,000 sterling or $3,200,000. The unsold lands were valued
at more than &pound;6,000 or nearly $30,000, and as the total
cost was &pound;764,500 or about $3,700,000, the direct loss to the
state, exclusive of interest on the capital expended, may be
stated at &pound;100,000 or something less than $500,000.</p>

<p>In a country like the United States, of almost boundless
extent of sparsely inhabited territory, such an expenditure for
such an object would be poor economy. But Holland has a
narrow domain, great pecuniary resources, an excessively
crowded population, and a consequent need of enlarged room
and opportunity for the exercise of industry. Under such circumstances,
and especially with an exposure to dangers so
formidable, there is no question of the wisdom of the measure.
It has already provided homes and occupation for more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
five thousand citizens, and furnished a profitable investment
for a capital of not less than &pound;400,000 sterling or $2,000,000,
which has been expended in improvements over and above the
purchase money of the soil; and the greater part of this sum,
as well as of the cost of drainage, has been paid as a compensation
for labor. The excess of governmental expenditure over
the receipts, if employed in constructing ships of war or fortifications,
would have added little to the military strength of the
kingdom; but the increase of territory, the multiplication of
homes and firesides which the people have an interest in defending,
and the augmentation of agricultural resources, constitute
a stronger bulwark against foreign invasion than a ship
of the line or a fortress armed with a hundred cannon.</p>

<p>The bearing of the works I have noticed, and of others
similar in character, upon the social and moral, as well as the
purely economical interests of the people of the Netherlands,
has induced me to describe them more in detail than the general
purpose of this volume may be thought to justify; but if
we consider them simply from a geographical point of view,
we shall find that they are possessed of no small importance as
modifications of the natural condition of terrestrial surface.
There is good reason to believe that before the establishment
of a partially civilized race upon the territory now occupied
by Dutch, Frisic, and Low German communities, the grounds
not exposed to inundation were overgrown with dense woods,
that the lowlands between these forests and the sea coasts were
marshes, covered and partially solidified by a thick matting
of peat plants and shrubs interspersed with trees, and that
even the sand dunes of the shore were protected by a vegetable
growth which, in a great measure, prevented the drifting
and translocation of them.</p>

<p>The present causes of river and coast erosion existed, indeed,
at the period in question; but some of them must have
acted with less intensity, there were strong natural safeguards
against the influence of marine and fresh-water currents, and
the conflicting tendencies had arrived at a condition of approximate
equilibrium, which permitted but slow and gradual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
changes in the face of nature. The destruction of the forests
around the sources and along the valleys of the rivers by man
gave them a more torrential character. The felling of the
trees, and the extirpation of the shrubbery upon the fens by
domestic cattle, deprived the surface of cohesion and consistence,
and the cutting of peat for fuel opened cavities in it,
which, filling at once with water, rapidly extended themselves
by abrasion of their borders, and finally enlarged to pools,
lakes, and gulfs, like the Lake of Haarlem and the northern
part of the Zuiderzee. The cutting of the wood and the depasturing
of the grasses upon the sand dunes converted them from
solid bulwarks against the ocean to loose accumulations of
dust, which every sea breeze drove farther landward, burying,
perhaps, fertile soil and choking up watercourses on one side,
and exposing the coast to erosion by the sea upon the other.</p>


<h4>c. <i>Geographical Influence of such Operations.</i></h4>

<p><a name="Page_352_2" id="Page_352_2"></a>The changes which human action has produced within
twenty centuries in the Netherlands and the neighboring provinces,
are certainly of no small geographical importance, considered
simply as a direct question of loss and gain of territory.
They have also undoubtedly been attended with some climatic
consequences, they have exercised a great influence on the
spontaneous animal and vegetable life of this region, and they
cannot have failed to produce effects upon tidal and other
oceanic currents, the range of which may be very extensive.
The force of the tidal wave, the height to which it rises, the
direction of its currents, and, in fact, all the phenomena which
characterize it, as well as all the effects it produces, depend as
much upon the configuration of the coast it washes, and the
depth of water, and form of bottom near the shore, as upon
the attraction which occasions it. Every one of the terrestrial
conditions which affect the character of tidal and other marine
currents has been very sensibly modified by the operations I
have described, and on this coast, at least, man has acted
almost as powerfully on the physical geography of the sea as
on that of the land.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Lowering of Lakes.</i></h4>

<p>The hydraulic works of the Netherlands and of the neighboring
states are of such magnitude, that they quite throw into
the shade all other known artificial arrangements for defending
the land against the encroachments of the rivers and the sea,
and for reclaiming to the domain of agriculture and civilization
soil long covered by the waters. But although the recovery
and protection of lands flooded by the sea seems to be
an art wholly of Netherlandish origin, we have abundant evidence,
that in ancient as well as in comparatively modern
times, great enterprises more or less analogous in character
have been successfully undertaken, both in inland Europe and
in the less familiar countries of the East.</p>

<p>One of the best known of these is the tunnel which serves
to discharge the surplus waters of the Lake of Albano, about
fourteen miles from Rome. This lake, about six miles in circuit,
occupies one of the craters of an extinct volcanic range,
and the surface of its waters is about nine hundred feet above
the sea. It is fed by rivulets and subterranean springs originating
in the Alban Mount, or Monte Cavo, the most elevated
peak of the volcanic group just mentioned, which rises to the
height of about three thousand feet. At present the lake has
no discoverable natural outlet, but it is not known that the
water ever stood at such a height as to flow regularly over the
lip of the crater. It seems that at the earliest period of which
we have any authentic memorials, its level was usually kept
by evaporation, or by discharge through subterranean channels,
considerably below the rim of the basin which encompassed
it, but in the year 397 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, the water, either from the
obstruction of such channels, or in consequence of increased
supplies from unknown sources, rose to such a height as to
flow over the edge of the crater, and threaten inundation to
the country below by bursting through its walls. To obviate
this danger, a tunnel for carrying off the water was pierced at
a level much below the height to which it had risen. This
gallery, cut entirely with the chisel through the rock for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
distance of six thousand feet, or nearly a mile and one seventh,
is still in so good condition as to serve its original purpose.
The fact that this work was contemporaneous with the siege
of Veii, has given to ancient annalists occasion to connect the
two events, but modern critics are inclined to reject Livy's
account of the matter, as one of the many improbable fables
which disfigure the pages of that historian. It is, however,
repeated by Cicero and by Dionysins of Halicarnassus, and it
is by no means impossible that, in an age when priests and
soothsayers monopolized both the arts of natural magic and the
little which yet existed of physical science, the Government of
Rome, by their aid, availed itself at once of the superstition
and of the military ardor of its citizens to obtain their sanction
to an enterprise which sounder arguments might not have
induced them to approve.</p>

<p>Still more remarkable is the tunnel cut by the Emperor
Claudius to drain the Lake Fucinus, now Lago di Celano, in
the Neapolitan territory, about fifty miles eastward of Rome.
This lake, as far as its history is known, has varied very considerably
in its dimensions at different periods, according to
the character of the seasons. It has no visible outlet, but was
originally either drained by natural subterranean conduits, or
kept within certain extreme limits by evaporation. In years
of uncommon moisture, it spread over the adjacent soil and
destroyed the crops; in dry seasons, it retreated, and produced
epidemic disease by poisonous exhalations from the decay of
vegetable and animal matter upon its exposed bed. Julius
C&aelig;sar had proposed the construction of a tunnel to drain the
lake, but the enterprise was not actually undertaken until the
reign of Claudius, when&mdash;after a temporary failure, from
errors in levelling by the engineers, as was pretended at the
time, or, as now appears certain, in consequence of frauds by
the contractors in the execution of the work&mdash;it was at least
partially completed. From this imperfect construction, it
soon got out of repair, but was restored by Hadrian, and seems
to have answered its design for some centuries. In the barbarism
which followed the downfall of the empire, it again fell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
into decay, and though numerous attempts were made to repair
it during the Middle Ages, no tolerable success seems to
have attended any of these efforts, until the present generation.</p>

<p>Works have now been some years in progress for restoring,
or rather enlarging and rebuilding this ancient tunnel, upon a
scale of grandeur which does infinite honor to the liberality
and public spirit of the projectors, and with an ingenuity of
design and a constructive skill which reflect the highest credit
upon the professional ability of the engineers who have planned
the works and directed their execution. The length of this
tunnel is 18,634 feet, or rather more than three miles and a
half. Of course, it is one of the longest subterranean galleries
yet executed in Europe, and it offers many curious particulars
in its original design which cannot here be described. The
difference between the highest and the lowest known levels of
the surface of the lake amounts to at least forty feet, and the
difference of area covered at these respective stages is not
much less than eight thousand acres. The tunnel will reduce
the water to a much lower point, and it is computed
that, including the lands occasionally overflowed, not less than
forty thousand acres of as fertile soil as any in Italy will be
recovered from the lake and permanently secured from inundation
by its waters.</p>

<p>Many similar enterprises have been conceived and executed
in modern times, both for the purpose of reclaiming
land covered by water and for sanitary reasons.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> They are
sometimes attended with wholly unexpected evils, as, for example,
in the case of Barton Pond, in Vermont, and in that
of the Lake Storsj&ouml;, in Sweden, already mentioned on a former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
page. Another still less obvious consequence of the withdrawal
of the waters has occasionally been observed in these
operations. The hydrostatic force with which the water, in
virtue of its specific gravity, presses against the banks that
confine it, has a tendency to sustain them whenever their composition
and texture are not such as to expose them to softening
and dissolution by the infiltration of the water. If then,
the slope of the banks is considerable, or if the earth of which
they are composed rests on a smooth and slippery stratum
inclining toward the bed of the lake, they are liable to fall or
slide forward when the mechanical support of the water is
removed, and this sometimes happens on a considerable scale.
A few years ago, the surface of the Lake of Lungern, in the
Canton of Unterwalden, in Switzerland, was lowered by driving
a tunnel about a quarter of a mile long through the narrow
ridge, called the Kaiserstuhl, which forms a barrier at the
north end of the basin. When the water was drawn off, the
banks, which are steep, cracked and burst, several acres of
ground slid down as low as the water receded, and even the
whole village of Lungern was thought to be in no small danger.</p>

<p>Other inconveniences of a very serious character have often
resulted from the natural wearing down, or, much more frequently,
the imprudent destruction, of the barriers which confine
mountain lakes. In their natural condition, such basins
serve both to receive and retain the rocks and other detritus
brought down by the torrents which empty into them, and to
check the impetus of the rushing waters by bringing them to
a temporary pause; but if the outlets are lowered so as to
drain the reservoirs, the torrents continue their rapid flow
through the ancient bed of the basins, and carry down with
them the sand and gravel with which they are charged, instead
of depositing their burden as before in the still waters of
the lakes.</p>


<h4><i>Mountain Lakes.</i></h4>

<p>It is a common opinion in America that the river meadows,
bottoms, or <i>intervales</i>, as they are popularly called, are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
generally the beds of ancient lakes which have burst their
barriers and left running currents in their place. It was shown
by Dr. Dwight, many years ago, that this is very far from
being universally true; but there is no doubt that mountain
lakes were of much more frequent occurrence in primitive
than in modern geography, and there are many chains of such
still existing in regions where man has yet little disturbed the
original features of the earth. In the long valleys of the Adirondack
range in Northern New York, and in the mountainous
parts of Maine, eight, ten, and even more lakes and
lakelets are sometimes found in succession, each emptying into
the next lower pool, and so all at last into some considerable
river. When the mountain slopes which supply these basins
shall be stripped of their woods, the augmented swelling of
the lakes will break down their barriers, their waters will run
off, and the valleys will present successions of flats with rivers
running through them, instead of chains of lakes connected by
natural canals.</p>

<p>A similar state of things seems to have existed in the ancient
geography of France. "Nature," says Lavergne, "has
not excavated on the flanks of our Alps reservoirs as magnificent
as those of Lombardy; she had, however, constructed
smaller, but more numerous lakes, which the negligence of
man has permitted to disappear. Auguste de Gasparin,
brother of the illustrious agriculturist, demonstrated more
than thirty years ago, in an original paper, that many natural
dikes formerly existed in the mountain valleys, which have
been swept away by the waters. He proposed to rebuild and
to multiply them. This interesting suggestion has reappeared
several times since, but has met with strong opposition from
skilful engineers. It would, nevertheless, be well to try the
experiment of creating artificial lakes which should fill themselves
with the water of melting snows and deluging rains, to
be drawn out in times of drought. If this plan has able opposers,
it has also warm advocates. Experience alone can
decide the question."<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<h4><i>Climatic Effects of Draining Lakes and Marshes.</i></h4>

<p>The draining of lakes, marshes, and other superficial accumulations
of moisture, reduces the water surface of a country,
and, of course, the evaporation from it. Lakes, too, in elevated
positions, lose a part of their water by infiltration, and thereby
supply other lakes, springs, and rivulets at lower levels. Hence,
it is evident that the draining of such waters, if carried on
upon a large scale, must affect both the humidity and the temperature
of the atmosphere, and the permanent supply of
water for extensive districts.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>


<h4><i>Geographical and Climatic Effects of Aqueducts, Reservoirs,
and Canals.</i></h4>

<p>Many processes of internal improvement, such as aqueducts
for the supply of great cities, railroad cuts and embankments,
and the like, divert water from its natural channels,
and affect its distribution and ultimate discharge. The collecting
of the waters of a considerable district into reservoirs,
to be thence carried off by means of aqueducts, as, for example,
in the forest of Belgrade, near Constantinople, deprives
the grounds originally watered by the springs and rivulets of
the necessary moisture, and reduces them to barrenness. Similar
effects must have followed from the construction of the
numerous aqueducts which supplied ancient Rome with such
a profuse abundance of water. On the other hand, the filtration
of water through the banks or walls of an aqueduct car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>ried
upon a high level across low ground, often injures the
adjacent soil, and is prejudicial to the health of the neighboring
population; and it has been observed in Switzerland, that
fevers have been produced by the stagnation of the water in
excavations from which earth had been taken to form embankments
for railways.</p>

<p>If we consider only the influence of physical improvements
on civilized life, we shall perhaps ascribe to navigable canals a
higher importance, or at least a more diversified influence,
than to any other works of man designed to control the waters
of the earth, and to affect their distribution, They bind distant
regions together by social ties, through the agency of the
commerce they promote; they facilitate the transportation of
military stores and engines, and of other heavy material connected
with the discharge of the functions of government; they
encourage industry by giving marketable value to raw material
and to objects of artificial elaboration which would otherwise
be worthless on account of the cost of conveyance; they
supply from their surplus waters means of irrigation and of
mechanical power; and, in many other ways, they contribute
much to advance the prosperity and civilization of nations. Nor
are they wholly without geographical importance. They sometimes
drain lands by conveying off water which would otherwise
stagnate on the surface, and, on the other hand, like aqueducts,
they render the neighboring soil cold and moist by the
percolation of water through their embankments;<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> they dam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
up, check, and divert the course of natural currents, and deliver
them at points opposite to, or distant from, their original
outlets; they often require extensive reservoirs to feed them,
thus retaining through the year accumulations of water&mdash;which
would otherwise run off, or evaporate in the dry season&mdash;and
thereby enlarging the evaporable surface of the
country; and we have already seen that they interchange the
flora and the fauna of provinces widely separated by nature.
All these modes of action certainly influence climate and the
character of terrestrial surface, though our means of observation
are not yet perfected enough to enable us to appreciate
and measure their effects.</p>


<h4><i>Climatic and Geographical Effects of Surface and
Underground Draining.</i></h4>

<p>I have commenced this chapter with a description of the
dikes and other hydraulic works of the Netherland engineers,
because the geographical results of such operations are more
obvious and more easily measured, though certainly not more
important, than those of the older and more widely diffused
modes of resisting or directing the flow of waters, which have
been practised from remote antiquity in the interior of all
civilized countries. Draining and irrigation are habitually
regarded as purely agricultural processes, having little or no
relation to technical geography; but we shall find that they
exert a powerful influence on soil, climate, and animal and
vegetable life, and may, therefore, justly claim to be regarded
as geographical elements.</p>

<h4><i>Surface and Under-draining and their Effects.</i></h4>

<p>Superficial draining is a necessity in all lands newly reclaimed
from the forest. The face of the ground in the woods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
is never so regularly inclined as to permit water to flow freely
over it. There are, even on the hillsides, many small ridges
and depressions, partly belonging to the original distribution
of the soil, and partly occasioned by irregularities in the
growth and deposit of vegetable matter. These, in the husbandry
of nature, serve as dams and reservoirs to collect a
larger supply of moisture than the spongy earth can at once
imbibe. Besides this, the vegetable mould is, even under the
most favorable circumstances, slow in parting with the humidity
it has accumulated under the protection of the woods,
and the infiltration from neighboring forests contributes to
keep the soil of small clearings too wet for the advantageous
cultivation of artificial crops. For these reasons, surface draining
must have commenced with agriculture itself, and there is
probably no cultivated district, one may almost say no single
field, which is not provided with artificial arrangements for
facilitating the escape of superficial water, and thus carrying off
moisture which, in the natural condition of the earth, would
have been imbibed by the soil.</p>

<p>The beneficial effects of surface drainage, the necessity of
extending the fields as population increased, and the inconveniences
resulting from the presence of marshes in otherwise
improved regions, must have suggested at a very early period
of human industry the expediency of converting bogs and
swamps into dry land by drawing off their waters; and it
would not be long after the introduction of this practice before
further acquisition of agricultural territory would be made by
lowering the outlet of small ponds and lakes, and adding the
ground they covered to the domain of the husbandman.</p>

<p>All these processes belong to the incipient civilization of
the ante-historical periods, but the construction of subterranean
channels for the removal of infiltrated water marks ages and
countries distinguished by a great advance in agricultural
theory and practice, a great accumulation of pecuniary capital,
and a density of population which creates a ready demand and
a high price for all products of rural industry. Under-draining,
too, would be most advantageous in damp and cool cli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>mates,
where evaporation is slow, and upon soils where the
natural inclination of surface does not promote a very rapid
flow of the surface waters. All the conditions required to
make this mode of rural improvement, if not absolutely necessary,
at least apparently profitable, exist in Great Britain, and
it is, therefore, very natural that the wealthy and intelligent
farmers of England should have carried this practice farther,
and reaped a more abundant pecuniary return from it, than
those of any other country.</p>

<p>Besides superficial and subsoil drains, there is another
method of disposing of superfluous surface water, which, however,
can rarely be practised, because the necessary conditions
for its employment are not of frequent occurrence. Whenever
a tenacious water-holding stratum rests on a loose, gravelly
bed, so situated as to admit of a free discharge of water from
or through it by means of the outcropping of the bed at a lower
level, or of deep-lying conduits leading to distant points of
discharge, superficial waters may be carried off by opening a
passage for them through the impervious into the permeable
stratum. Thus, according to Bischof, as early as the time of
King R&eacute;n&eacute;, in the first half of the fifteenth century, the plain
of Paluns, near Marseilles, was laid dry by boring, and Wittwer
informs us that drainage is effected at Munich by conducting
the superfluous water into large excavations, from which it
filters through into a lower stratum of pebble and gravel lying
a little above the level of the river Isar.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> So at Washington,
in the western part of the city, which lies high above the rivers
Potomac and Rock Creek, many houses are provided with dry
wells for draining their cellars and foundations. These extend
through hard tenacious earth to the depth of thirty or forty
feet, when they strike a stratum of gravel, through which the
water readily passes off.</p>

<p>This practice has been extensively employed at Paris, not
merely for carrying off ordinary surface water, but for the dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>charge
of offensive and deleterious fluids from chemical and
manufacturing establishments. A well of this sort received,
in the winter of 1832-'33, twenty thousand gallons per day
of the foul water from a starch factory, and the same process
was largely used in other factories. The apprehension of
injury to common and artesian wells and springs led to an
investigation on this subject, in behalf of the municipal authorities,
by Girard and Parent Duchatelet, in the latter year.
The report of these gentlemen, published in the <i>Annales des
Ponts et Chauss&eacute;es</i> for 1833, second half year, is full of curious
and instructive facts respecting the position and distribution
of the subterranean waters under and near Paris; but it must
suffice to say that the report came to the conclusion that, in
consequence of the absolute immobility of these waters, and
the relatively small quantity of noxious fluid to be conveyed
to them, there was no danger of the diffusion of this latter, if
discharged into them. This result will not surprise those who
know that, in another work, Duchatelet maintains analogous
opinions as to the effect of the discharge of the city sewers
into the Seine upon the waters of that river. The quantity of
matter delivered by them he holds to be so nearly infinitesimal,
as compared with the volume of water of the Seine, that
it cannot possibly affect it to a sensible degree. I would, however,
advise determined water drinkers living at Paris to adopt
his conclusions, without studying his facts and his arguments;
for it is quite possible that he may convert his readers to a
faith opposite to his own, and that they will finally agree with
the poet who held water an "ignoble beverage."</p>


<h4><i>Climatic and Geographical Effects of Surface Draining.</i></h4>

<p>When we remove water from the surface, we diminish the
evaporation from it, and, of course, the refrigeration which
accompanies all evaporation is diminished in proportion.
Hence superficial draining ought to be attended with an elevation
of atmospheric temperature, and, in cold countries, it
might be expected to lessen the frequency of frosts. Accordingly,
it is a fact of experience that, other things being equal,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
dry soils, and the air in contact with them, are perceptibly
warmer during the season of vegetation, when evaporation is
most rapid, than moist lands and the atmospheric stratum
resting upon them. Instrumental observation on this special
point has not yet been undertaken on a very large scale, but
still we have thermometric data sufficient to warrant the general
conclusion, and the influence of drainage in diminishing the
frequency of frost appears to be even better established than a
direct increase of atmospheric temperature. The steep and
dry uplands of the Green Mountain range in New England
often escape frosts when the Indian corn harvest on moister
grounds, five hundred or even a thousand feet lower, is destroyed
or greatly injured by them. The neighborhood of a
marsh is sure to be exposed to late spring and early autumnal
frosts, but they cease to be feared after it is drained, and this
is particularly observable in very cold climates, as, for example,
in Lapland.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>In England, under-drains are not generally laid below the
reach of daily variations of temperature, or below a point from
which moisture might be brought to the surface by capillary
attraction and evaporated by the heat of the sun. They, therefore,
like surface drains, withdraw from local solar action much
moisture which would otherwise be vaporized by it, and, at
the same time, by drying the soil above them, they increase its
effective hygroscopicity, and it consequently absorbs from the
atmosphere a greater quantity of water than it did when, for
want of under-drainage, the subsoil was always humid, if not
saturated. Under-drains, then, contribute to the dryness as
well as to the warmth of the atmosphere, and, as dry ground
is more readily heated by the rays of the sun than wet, they
tend also to raise the mean, and especially the summer temperature
of the soil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p>So far as respects the immediate improvement of soil and
climate, and the increased abundance of the harvests, the English
system of surface and subsoil drainage has fully justified
the eulogiums of its advocates; but its extensive adoption
appears to have been attended with some altogether unforeseen
and undesirable consequences, very analogous to those which
I have described as resulting from the clearing of the forests.
The under-drains carry off very rapidly the water imbibed by
the soil from precipitation, and through infiltration from neighboring
springs or other sources of supply. Consequently, in
wet seasons, or after heavy rains, a river bordered by artificially
drained lands receives in a few hours, from superficial
and from subterranean conduits, an accession of water which,
in the natural state of the earth, would have reached it only
by small instalments after percolating through hidden paths
for weeks or even months, and would have furnished perennial
and comparatively regular contributions, instead of swelling
deluges, to its channel. Thus, when human impatience rashly
substitutes swiftly acting artificial contrivances for the slow
methods by which nature drains the surface and superficial
strata of a river basin, the original equilibrium is disturbed,
the waters of the heavens are no longer stored up in the earth
to be gradually given out again, but are hurried out of man's
domain with wasteful haste; and while the inundations of the
river are sudden and disastrous, its current, when the drains
have run dry, is reduced to a rivulet, it ceases to supply the
power to drive the machinery for which it was once amply
sufficient, and scarcely even waters the herds that pasture upon
its margin.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>


<h4><i>Irrigation and its Climatic and Geographical Effects.</i></h4>

<p>We know little of the history of the extinct civilizations
which preceded the culture of the classic ages, and no nation
has, in modern times, spontaneously emerged from barbarism,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
and created for itself the arts of social life.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> The improvements
of the savage races whose history we can distinctly trace
are borrowed and imitative, and our theories as to the origin
and natural development of industrial art are conjectural. Of
course, the relative antiquity of particular branches of human
industry depends much upon the natural character of soil, climate,
and spontaneous vegetable and animal life in different
countries; and while the geographical influence of man would,
under given circumstances, be exerted in one direction, it
would, under different conditions, act in an opposite or a
diverging line. I have given some reasons for thinking that
in the climates to which our attention has been chiefly directed,
man's first interference with the natural arrangement and disposal
of the waters was in the way of drainage of surface.
But if we are to judge from existing remains alone, we should
probably conclude that irrigation is older than drainage; for,
in the regions regarded by general tradition as the cradle of
the human race, we find traces of canals evidently constructed
for the former purpose at a period long preceding the ages of
which we have any written memorials. There are, in ancient
Armenia, extensive districts which were already abandoned to
desolation at the earliest historical epoch, but which, in a yet
remoter antiquity, had been irrigated by a complicated and
highly artificial system of canals, the lines of which can still
be followed; and there are, in all the highlands where the
sources of the Euphrates rise, in Persia, in Egypt, in India,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
and in China, works of this sort which must have been in
existence before man had begun to record his own annals.</p>

<p>In warm countries, such as most of those just mentioned,
the effects I have described as usually resulting from the clearing
of the forests would very soon follow. In such climates,
the rains are inclined to be periodical; they are also violent,
and for these reasons the soil would be parched in summer
and liable to wash in winter. In these countries, therefore, the
necessity for irrigation must soon have been felt, and its introduction
into mountainous regions like Armenia must have
been immediately followed by a system of terracing, or at
least scarping the hillsides. Pasture and meadow, indeed,
may be irrigated even when the surface is both steep and irregular,
as may be observed abundantly on the Swiss as well as
on the Piedmontese slope of the Alps; but in dry climates,
plough land and gardens on hilly grounds require terracing,
both for supporting the soil and for administering water by
irrigation, and it should be remembered that terracing, of
itself, even without special arrangements for controlling the
distribution of water, prevents or at least checks the flow of
rain water, and gives it time to sink into the ground instead
of running off over the surface.</p>

<p>There are few things in Continental husbandry which surprise
English or American observers so much as the extent to
which irrigation is employed in agriculture, and that, too, on
soils, and with a temperature, where their own experience
would have led them to suppose it would be injurious to vegetation
rather than beneficial to it. The summers in Northern
Italy, though longer, are very often not warmer than in New
England; and in ordinary years, the summer rains are as frequent
and as abundant in the former country as in the latter.
Yet in Piedmont and Lombardy, irrigation is bestowed upon
almost every crop, while in New England it is never employed
at all in farming husbandry, or indeed for any purpose except
in kitchen gardens, and possibly, in rare cases, in some other
small branch of agricultural industry.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p>The summers in Egypt, in Syria, and in Asia Minor and
even Rumelia, are almost rainless. In such climates, the
necessity of irrigation is obvious, and the loss of the ancient
means of furnishing it readily explains the diminished fertility
of most of the countries in question.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> The surface of Pales<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>tine,
for example, is composed, in a great measure, of rounded
limestone hills, once, no doubt, covered with forests. These
were partially removed before the Jewish conquest.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> When

waters of winter were hewn in the rock near the tops of the
hills, and the declivities were terraced. So long as the cisterns
were in good order, and the terraces kept up, the fertility of
Palestine was unsurpassed, but when misgovernment and for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>eign
and intestine war occasioned the neglect or destruction
of these works&mdash;traces of which still meet the traveller's eye at
every step,&mdash;when the reservoirs were broken and the terrace
walls had fallen down, there was no longer water for irrigation
in summer, the rains of winter soon washed away most of the
thin layer of earth upon the rocks, and Palestine was reduced
almost to the condition of a desert.</p>

<p>The course of events has been the same in Idum&aelig;a. The
observing traveller discovers everywhere about Petra, particularly
if he enters the city by the route of Wadi Ksheibeh,
very extensive traces of ancient cultivation, and upon the
neighboring ridges are the ruins of numerous cisterns evidently
constructed to furnish a supply of water for irrigation.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
primitive ages, the precipitation of winter in these hilly countries
was, in great part, retained for a time in the superficial
soil, first by the vegetable mould of the forests, and then by
the artificial arrangements I have described. The water imbibed
by the earth was partly taken up by direct evaporation,
partly absorbed by vegetation, and partly carried down by
infiltration to subjacent strata which gave it out in springs at
lower levels, and thus a fertility of soil and a condition of the
atmosphere were maintained sufficient to admit of the dense
population that once inhabited those now arid wastes. At
present, the rain water runs immediately off from the surface
and is carried down to the sea, or is drunk up by the sands of
the wadis, and the hillsides which once teemed with plenty
are bare of vegetation, and seared by the scorching winds of
the desert.</p>

<p>In Southern Europe, in the Turkish Empire, and in many
other countries, a very large proportion of the surface is, if not
absolutely flooded, at least thoroughly moistened by irrigation,
a great number of times in the course of every season, and this,
especially, at periods when it would otherwise be quite dry,
and when, too, the power of the sun and the capacity of the
air for absorbing moisture are greatest. Hence it is obvious
that the amount of evaporation from the earth in these countries,
and, of course, the humidity and the temperature of both
the soil and the atmosphere in contact with it, must be much
affected by the practice of irrigation. The cultivable area of
Egypt, or the space accessible to cultivation, between desert
and desert, is more than seven thousand square statute miles.
Much of the surface, though not out of the reach of irrigation,
lies too high to be economically watered, and irrigation and
cultivation are therefore confined to an area of five or six thousand
square miles, nearly the whole of which is regularly and
constantly watered when not covered by the inundation, except
in the short interval between the harvest and the rise of
the waters. For nearly half of the year, then, irrigation adds
five or six thousand square miles, or more than a square equatorial
degree, to the evaporable surface of the Nile valley, or,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
in other words, more than decuples the area from which an
appreciable quantity of moisture would otherwise be evaporated;
for after the Nile has retired within its banks, its
waters by no means cover one tenth of the space just mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
The fresh-water canals now constructing, in connec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>tion
with the works for the Suez canal, will not only restore
the long abandoned fields east of the Nile, but add to the arable
soil of Egypt hundreds of square miles of newly reclaimed
desert, and thus still further increase the climatic effects of
irrigation.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>The Nile receives not a single tributary in its course through
Egypt; there is not so much as one living spring in the whole
land,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> and, with the exception of a narrow strip of coast, where
the annual precipitation is said to amount to six inches, the
fall of rain in the territory of the Pharaohs is not two inches
in the year. The subsoil of the whole valley is pervaded with
moisture by infiltration from the Nile, and water can everywhere
be found at the depth of a few feet. Were irrigation
suspended, and Egypt abandoned, as in that case it must be,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
to the operations of nature, there is no doubt that trees, the
roots of which penetrate deeply, would in time establish themselves
on the deserted soil, fill the valley with verdure, and
perhaps at last temper the climate, and even call down abundant
rain from the heavens.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> But the immediate effect of
discontinuing irrigation would be, first, an immense reduction
of the evaporation from the valley in the dry season, and then
a greatly augmented dryness and heat of the atmosphere.
Even the almost constant north wind&mdash;the strength of which
would be increased in consequence of these changes&mdash;would
little reduce the temperature of the narrow cleft between the
burning mountains which hem in the channel of the Nile, so
that a single year would transform the most fertile of soils to
the most barren of deserts, and render uninhabitable a territory
that irrigation makes capable of sustaining as dense a
population as has ever existed in any part of the world.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
Whether man found the valley of the Nile a forest, or such a
waste as I have just described, we do not historically know.
In either case, he has not simply converted a wilderness into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
a garden, but has unquestionably produced extensive climatic
change.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>The fields of Egypt are more regularly watered than those
of any other country bordering on the Mediterranean, except
the rice grounds in Italy, and perhaps the <i>marcite</i> or winter
meadows of Lombardy; but irrigation is more or less employed
throughout almost the entire basin of that sea, and is everywhere
attended with effects which, if less in degree, are analogous
in character to those resulting from it in Egypt. In
general, it may be said that the soil is nowhere artificially
watered except when it is so dry that little moisture would be
evaporated from it, and, consequently, every acre of irrigated
ground is so much added to the evaporable surface of the
country. When the supply of water is unlimited, it is allowed,
after serving its purpose on one field, to run into drains, canals,
or rivers. But in most regions where irrigation is regularly
employed, it is necessary to economize the water; after passing
over or through one parcel of ground, it is conducted to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
another; no more is withdrawn from the canals at any one
point than is absorbed by the soil it irrigates, or evaporated
from it, and, consequently, it is not restored to liquid circulation,
except by infiltration or precipitation. We are safe, then,
in saying that the humidity evaporated from any artificially
watered soil is increased by a quantity bearing a large proportion
to the whole amount distributed over it; for most even
of that which is absorbed by the earth is immediately given
out again either by vegetables or by evaporation.</p>

<p>It is not easy to ascertain precisely either the extent of surface
thus watered, or the amount of water supplied, in any
given country, because these quantities vary with the character
of the season; but there are not many districts in Southern Europe
where the management of the arrangements for irrigation
is not one of the most important branches of agricultural labor.
The eminent engineer Lombardini describes the system of irrigation
in Lombardy as, "every day in summer, diffusing
over 550,000 hectares of land 45,000,000 cubic m&egrave;tres of water,
which is equal to the entire volume of the Seine, at an ordinary
flood, or a rise of three m&egrave;tres above the hydrometer at
the bridge of La Tournelle at Paris."<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Niel states the quantity
of land irrigated in the former kingdom of Sardinia, including
Savoy, in 1856, at 240,000 hectares, or not much less than
600,000 acres. This is about four thirteenths of the cultivable
soil of the kingdom. According to the same author, the irrigated
lands in France did not exceed 100,000 hectares, or
247,000 acres, while those in Lombardy amounted to 450,000
hectares, more than 1,100,000 acres.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> In these three states
alone, then, there were more than three thousand square miles
of artificially watered land, and if we add the irrigated soils
of the rest of Italy, of the Mediterranean islands, of the Spanish
peninsula, of Turkey in Europe and in Asia Minor, of
Syria, of Egypt and the remainder of Northern Africa, we
shall see that irrigation increases the evaporable surface of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
Mediterranean basin by a quantity bearing no inconsiderable
proportion to the area naturally covered by water within it.
As near as can be ascertained, the amount of water applied
to irrigated lands is scarcely anywhere less than the total precipitation
during the season of vegetable growth, and in general
it much exceeds that quantity. In grass grounds and in
field culture it ranges from 27 or 28 to 60 inches, while in
smaller crops, tilled by hand labor, it is sometimes carried as
high as 300 inches.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> The rice grounds and the <i>marcite</i> of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
Lombardy are not included in these estimates of the amount
of water applied. Arrangements are concluded, and new
plans proposed, for an immense increase of the lands fertilized
by irrigation in France and Italy, and there is every reason to
believe that the artificially watered soil of the latter country
will be doubled, that of France quadrupled, before the end of
this century. There can be no doubt that by these operations
man is exercising a powerful influence on soil, on vegetable
and animal life, and on climate, and hence that in this, as
in many other fields of industry, he is truly a geographical
agency.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
The quantity of water artificially withdrawn from running
streams for the purpose of irrigation is such as very sensibly
to affect their volume, and it is, therefore, an important element
in the geography of rivers. Brooks of no trifling current<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
are often wholly diverted from their natural channels to supply
the canals, and their entire mass of water completely
absorbed, so that it does not reach the river which it naturally
feeds, except in such proportion as it is conveyed to it by infiltration.
Irrigation, therefore, diminishes great rivers in warm
countries by cutting off their sources of supply as well as by
direct abstraction of water from their channels. We have just
seen that the system of irrigation in Lombardy deprives the
Po of a quantity of water equal to the total delivery of the
Seine at ordinary flood, or, in other words, of the equivalent
of a tributary navigable for hundreds of miles by vessels of
considerable burden. The new canals commenced and projected
will greatly increase the loss. The water required for
irrigation in Egypt is less than would be supposed from the
exceeding rapidity of evaporation in that arid climate; for the
soil is thoroughly saturated during the inundation, and infiltration
from the Nile continues to supply a considerable
amount of humidity in the dryest season. Linant Bey computed
that twenty-nine cubic m&egrave;tres per day sufficed to irrigate
a hectare in the Delta.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> This is equivalent to a fall of
rain of two millim&egrave;tres and nine tenths per day, or, if we suppose
water to be applied for one hundred and fifty days during
the dry season, to a total precipitation of 435 millim&egrave;tres,
about seventeen inches and one third. Taking the area of
actually cultivated soil in Egypt at the low estimate of
3,600,000 acres, and the average amount of water daily applied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
in both Upper and Lower Egypt at twelve hundredths of an
inch in depth, we have an abstraction of 61,000,000 cubic
yards, which&mdash;the mean daily delivery of the Nile being in
round numbers 320,000,000 cubic yards&mdash;is nearly one fifth
of the average quantity of water contributed to the Mediterranean
by that river.</p>

<p>Irrigation, as employed for certain special purposes in
Europe and America, is productive of very prejudicial climatic
effects. I refer particularly to the cultivation of rice in the
Slave States of the American Union and in Italy. The climate
of the Southern States is not necessarily unhealthy for the
white man, but he can scarcely sleep a single night in the
vicinity of the rice grounds without being attacked by a dangerous
fever.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> The neighborhood of the rice fields is less
pestilential in Lombardy and Piedmont than in South Carolina
and Georgia, but still very insalubrious to both man and
beast. "Not only does the population decrease where rice is
grown," says Escourrou Milliago, "but even the flocks are
attacked by typhus. In the rice grounds, the soil is divided
into compartments rising in gradual succession to the level of
the irrigating canal, in order that the water, after having
flowed one field, may be drawn off to another, and thus a
single current serve for several compartments, the lowest field,
of course, still being higher than the ditch which at last drains
both it and the adjacent soil. This arrangement gives a cer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>tain
force of hydrostatic pressure to the water with which the
rice is irrigated, and the infiltration from these fields is said to
extend through neighboring grounds, sometimes to the distance
of not less than a myriam&egrave;tre, or six English miles, and to be
destructive to crops and even trees reached by it. Land thus
affected can no longer be employed for any purpose but growing
rice, and when prepared for that crop, it propagates still
further the evils under which it had itself suffered, and, of
course, the mischief is a growing one."<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>The attentive traveller in Egypt and Nubia cannot fail to
notice many localities, generally of small extent, where the
soil is rendered infertile by an excess of saline matter in its
composition. In many cases, perhaps in all, these barren spots
lie rather above the level usually flooded by the inundations
of the Nile, and yet they exhibit traces of former cultivation.
Recent observations in India, a notice of which I find in an
account of a meeting of the Asiatic Society in the Athen&aelig;um
of December 20, 1862, No. 1834, suggest a possible explanation
of this fact. At this meeting, Professor Medlicott read an essay
on "the saline efflorescence called 'Reh' and 'Kuller,'"
which is gradually invading many of the most fertile districts
of Northern and Western India, and changing them into sterile
deserts. It consists principally of sulphate of soda (Glauber's
salts), with varying proportions of common salt. Mr. Medlicott
pronounces "these salts (which, in small quantities are
favorable to fertility of soil) to be the gradual result of concentration
by evaporation of river and canal waters, which contain
them in very minute quantities, and with which the lands are
either irrigated or occasionally overflowed." The river inundations
in hot countries usually take place but once in a year,
and, though the banks remain submerged for days or even
weeks, the water at that period, being derived principally from
rains and snows, must be less highly charged with mineral
matter than at lower stages, and besides, it is always in motion.
The water of irrigation, on the other hand, is applied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
for many months in succession, it is drawn from rivers at the
seasons when their proportion of salts is greatest, and it either
sinks into the superficial soil, carrying with it the saline substances
it holds in solution, or is evaporated from the surface,
leaving them upon it. Hence irrigation must impart to the
soil more salts than natural inundation. The sterilized
grounds in Egypt and Nubia lying above the reach of the
floods, as I have said, we may suppose them to have been first
cultivated in that remote antiquity when the Nile valley received
its earliest inhabitants. They must have been artificially
irrigated from the beginning; they may have been
under cultivation many centuries before the soil at a lower
level was invaded by man, and hence it is natural that they
should be more strongly impregnated with saline matter than
fields which are exposed every year, for some weeks, to the
action of running water so nearly pure that it would be more
likely to dissolve salts than to deposit them.</p>


<h4>INUNDATIONS AND TORRENTS.</h4>

<p>In pointing out in a former chapter the evils which have
resulted from the too extensive destruction of the forests, I
dwelt at some length on the increased violence of river inundations,
and especially on the devastations of torrents, in countries
improvidently deprived of their woods, and I spoke of
the replanting of the forests as the only effectual method of
preventing the frequent recurrence of disastrous floods. There
are many regions where, from the loss of the superficial soil,
from financial considerations, and from other causes, the restoration
of the woods is not, under present circumstances, to
be hoped for. Even where that measure is feasible and in
actual process of execution, a great number of years must
elapse before the action of the destructive causes in question
can be arrested or perhaps even sensibly mitigated by it. Besides
this, leaving out of view the objections urged by Belgrand
and his followers to the generally received opinions
concerning the beneficial influence of the forest as respects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
river inundations&mdash;for no one disputes its importance in preventing
the formation and limiting the ravages of mountain
torrents&mdash;floods will always occur in years of excessive precipitation,
whether the surface of the soil be generally cleared or
generally wooded.</p>

<p>Physical improvement in this respect, then, cannot he confined
to preventive measures, but, in countries subject to damage
by inundation, means must he contrived to obviate dangers
and diminish injuries to which human life and all the works
of human industry will occasionally be exposed, in spite of
every effort to lessen the frequency of their recurrence by
acting directly on the causes that produce them. As every
civilized country is, in some degree, subject to inundation by
the overflow of rivers, the evil is a familiar one, and needs no
general description. In discussing this branch of the subject,
therefore, I may confine myself chiefly to the means that have
been or may be employed to resist the force and limit the
ravages of floods, which, left wholly unrestrained, would not
only inflict immense injury upon the material interests of man,
but produce geographical revolutions of no little magnitude.</p>


<h4>a. <i>River Embankments.</i></h4>

<p>The most obvious and doubtless earliest method of preventing
the escape of river waters from their natural channels,
and the overflow of fields and towns by their spread, is that of
raised embankments along their course. The necessity of such
embankments usually arises from the gradual elevation of the
bed of running streams in consequence of the deposit of the
earth and gravel they are charged with in high water; and, as
we have seen, this elevation is rapidly accelerated when the
highlands around the headwaters of rivers are cleared of their
forests. When a river is embanked at a given point, and, consequently,
the water of its floods, which would otherwise
spread over a wide surface, is confined within narrow limits,
the velocity of the current and its transporting power are augmented,
and its burden of sand and gravel is deposited at some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
lower point, where the rapidity of its flow is checked by a
diminution in the inclination of the bed, by a wider channel,
or finally by a lacustrine or marine basin which receives its
waters. Wherever it lets fall solid material, its channel is
raised in consequence, and the declivity of the whole bed
between the head of the embankment and the slack of the
stream is reduced. Hence the current, at first accelerated by
confinement, is afterward checked by the mechanical resistance
of the matter deposited, and by the diminished inclination
of its channel, and then begins again to let fall the earth
it holds in suspension, and to raise its bed at the point where
its overflow had been before prevented by embankment. The
bank must now be raised in proportion, and these processes
would be repeated and repeated indefinitely, had not nature
provided a remedy in floods, which sweep out recent deposits,
burst the bonds of the river and overwhelm the adjacent country
with final desolation, or divert the current into a new
channel, destined to become, in its turn, the scene of a similar
struggle between man and the waters.</p>

<p>Few rivers, like the Nile, more than compensate by the
fertilizing properties of their water and their slime for the
damage they may do in inundations, and, consequently, there
are few whose floods are not an object of dread, few whose
encroachments upon their banks are not a source of constant
anxiety and expense to the proprietors of the lands through
which they flow. River dikes, for confining the spread of
currents at high water, are of great antiquity in the East, and
those of the Po and its tributaries were begun before we have
any trustworthy physical or political annals of the provinces
upon their borders. From the earliest ages, the Italian hydraulic
engineers have stood in the front rank of their profession,
and the Italian literature of this branch of material improvement
is exceedingly voluminous. But the countries for
which I write have no rivers like the Po, no plains like those
of Lombardy, and the dangers to which the inhabitants of
English and American river banks are exposed are more nearly
analogous to those that threaten the soil and population in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
valleys and plains of France, than to the perils and losses of
the Lombard. The writings of the Italian hydrographers, too,
though rich in professional instruction, are less accessible to
foreigners and less adapted to popular use than those of French
engineers.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> For these reasons I shall take my citations principally
from French authorities, though I shall occasionally
allude to Italian writers on the floods of the Tiber, of the Arno,
and some other Italian streams which much resemble those of
the rivers of England and the United States.</p>


<h4>b. <i>Floods of the Ard&egrave;che.</i></h4>

<p>The floods of mountain streams are attended with greater
immediate danger to life and property than those of rivers of
less rapid flow, because their currents are more impetuous, and
they rise more suddenly and with less previous warning. At
the same time, their ravages are confined within narrower
limits, the waters retire sooner to their accustomed channel,
and the danger is more quickly over, than in the case of inundations
of larger rivers. The Ard&egrave;che, which has given its
name to a department in France, drains a basin of 600,238
acres, or a little less than nine hundred and thirty-eight square
miles. Its remotest source is about seventy-five miles, in a
straight line, from its junction with the Rhone, and springs at
an elevation of four thousand feet above that point. At the
lowest stage of the river, the bed of the Chassezac, its largest
and longest tributary, is in many places completely dry on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
surface&mdash;the water being sufficient only to supply the subterranean
channels of infiltration&mdash;and the Ard&egrave;che itself is
almost everywhere fordable, even below the mouth of the
Chassezac. But in floods, the river has sometimes risen more
than sixty feet at the Pont d'Arc, a natural arch of two hundred
feet chord, which spans the stream below its junction
with all its important affluents. At the height of the inundation
of 1827, the quantity of water passing this point&mdash;after
deducting thirty per cent. for material transported with the
current and for irregularity of flow&mdash;was estimated at 8,845
cubic yards to the second, and between twelve at noon on the
10th of September of that year and ten o'clock the next
morning, the water discharged through the passage in question
amounted to more than 450,000,000 cubic yards. This quantity,
distributed equally through the basin of the river, would
cover its entire area to a depth of more than five inches.</p>

<p>The Ard&egrave;che rises so suddenly that, in the inundation of
1846, the women who were washing in the bed of the river
had not time to save their linen, and barely escaped with their
lives, though they instantly fled upon hearing the roar of the
approaching flood. Its waters and those of its affluents fall
almost as rapidly, for in less than twenty-four hours after the
rain has ceased in the C&eacute;vennes, where it rises, the Ard&egrave;che
returns within its ordinary channel, even at its junction with
the Rhone. In the flood of 1772, the water at La Beaume de
Ruoms, on the Beaume, a tributary of the Ard&egrave;che, rose thirty-five
feet above low water, but the stream was again fordable
on the evening of the same day. The inundation of 1827 was,
in this respect, exceptional, for it continued three days, during
which period the Ard&egrave;che poured into the Rhone 1,305,000,000
cubic yards of water.</p>

<p>The Nile delivers into the sea 101,000 cubic feet or 3,741
cubic yards per second, on an average of the whole year.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
This is equal to 323,222,400 cubic yards per day. In a single
day of flood, then, the Ard&egrave;che, a river too insignificant to be
known except in the local topography of France, contributed
to the Rhone once and a half, and for three consecutive days
once and one third, as much as the average delivery of the
Nile during the same periods, though the basin of the latter
river contains 500,000 square miles of surface, or more than
five hundred times as much as that of the former.</p>

<p>The average annual precipitation in the basin of the Ard&egrave;che
is not greater than in many other parts of Europe, but
excessive quantities of rain frequently fall in that valley in the
autumn. On the 9th of October, 1827, there fell at Joyeuse,
on the Beaume, no less than thirty-one inches between three
o'clock in the morning and midnight. Such facts as this explain
the extraordinary suddenness and violence of the floods
of the Ard&egrave;che, and the basins of many other tributaries of
the Rhone exhibit meteorological phenomena not less remarkable.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
The inundation of the 10th September, 1857, was
accompanied with a terrific hurricane, which passed along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
eastern slope of the high grounds where the Ard&egrave;che and several
other western affluents of the Rhone take their rise. The
wind tore up all the trees in its path, and the rushing torrents
bore their trunks down to the larger streams, which again transported
them to the Rhone in such rafts that one might almost
have crossed that river by stepping from trunk to trunk.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
The Rhone, therefore, is naturally subject to great and sudden
inundations, and the same remark may be applied to most of
the principal rivers of France, because the geographical character
of all of them is approximately the same.</p>

<p>The height and violence of the inundations of most great
rivers are determined by the degree in which the floods of the
different tributaries are coincident in time. Were all the affluents
of the Rhone to pour their highest annual floods into its
channel at once, were a dozen Niles to empty themselves into
its bed at the same moment, its water would rise to a height
and rush with an impetus that would sweep into the Mediterranean
the entire population of its banks, and all the works
that man has erected upon the plains which border it. But
such a coincidence can never happen. The tributaries of this
river run in very different directions, and some of them are
swollen principally by the melting of the snows about their
sources, others almost exclusively by heavy rains. When a
damp southeast wind blows up the valley of the Ard&egrave;che, its
moisture is condensed, and precipitated in a deluge upon the
mountains which embosom the headwaters of that stream,
thus producing a flood, while a neighboring basin, the axis of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
which lies transversely or obliquely to that of the Ard&egrave;che, is
not at all affected.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>It is easy to see that the damage occasioned by such floods
as I have described must be almost incalculable, and it is by
no means confined to the effects produced by overflow and the
mechanical force of the superficial currents. In treating of
the devastations of torrents in a former chapter, I confined
myself principally to the erosion of surface and the transportation
of mineral matter to lower grounds by them. The general
action of torrents, as there shown, tends to the ultimate
elevation of their beds by the deposit of the earth, gravel, and
stone conveyed by them; but until they have thus raised their
outlets so as sensibly to diminish the inclination of their channels&mdash;and
sometimes when extraordinary floods give the torrents
momentum enough to sweep away the accumulations
which they have themselves heaped up&mdash;the swift flow of their
currents, aided by the abrasion of the rolling rocks and gravel,
scoops their beds constantly deeper, and they consequently not
only undermine their banks, but frequently sap the most solid
foundations which the art of man can build for the support of
bridges and hydraulic structures.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<p>In the inundation of 1857, the Ard&egrave;che destroyed a stone
bridge near La Beaume, which had been built about eighty
years before. The resistance of the piers, which were erected
on piles, the channel at that point being of gravel, produced
an eddying current that washed away the bed of the river
above them, and the foundation, thus deprived of lateral support,
yielded to the weight of the bridge, and the piles and
piers fell up stream.</p>

<p>By a curious law of compensation, the stream which, at
flood, scoops out cavities in its bed, often fills them up again
as soon as the diminished velocity of the current allows it to
let fall the sand and gravel with which it is charged, so that
when the waters return to their usual channel, the bottom
shows no sign of having been disturbed. In a flood of the
Escontay, a tributary of the Rhone, in 1846, piles driven sixteen
feet into its gravelly bed for the foundation of a pier were
torn up and carried off, and yet, when the river had fallen to
low-water mark, the bottom at that point appeared to have
been raised higher than it was before the flood, by new deposits
of sand and gravel, while the cut stones of the half-built
pier were found buried to a great depth, in the excavation
which the water had first washed out. The gravel with which
rivers thus restore the level of their beds is principally derived
from the crushing of the rocks brought down by the mountain
torrents, and the destructive effects of inundations are immensely
diminished by this reduction of large stones to minute
fragments. If the blocks hurled down from the cliffs were
transported unbroken to the channels of large rivers, the mechanical
force of their movement would be irresistible. They
would overthrow the strongest barriers, spread themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
over a surface as wide as the flow of the waters, and convert
the most smiling valleys into scenes of the wildest desolation.</p>


<h4>c. <i>Crushing Force of Torrents.</i></h4>

<p>There are few operations of nature where the effect seems
more disproportioned to the cause than in the comminution of
rock in the channel of swift waters. Igneous rocks are generally
so hard as to be wrought with great difficulty, and they
bear the weight of enormous superstructures without yielding
to the pressure; but to the torrent they are as wheat to the millstone.
The streams which pour down the southern scarp of the
Mediterranean Alps along the Riviera di Ponente, near Genoa,
have short courses, and a brisk walk of a couple of hours or
even less takes you from the sea beach to the headspring of
many of them. In their heaviest floods, they bring rounded
masses of serpentine quite down to the sea, but at ordinary
high water their lower course is charged only with finely
divided particles of that rock. Hence, while, near their
sources, their channels are filled with pebbles and angular
fragments, intermixed with a little gravel, the proportions are
reversed near their mouths, and, just above the points where
their outlets are partially choked by the rolling shingle of the
beach, their beds are composed of sand and gravel to the
almost total exclusion of pebbles. The greatest depth of the
basin of the Ard&egrave;che is seventy-five miles, but most of its tributaries
have a much shorter course. "These affluents," says
Mardigny, "hurl into the bed of the Ard&egrave;che enormous blocks
of rock, which this river, in its turn, bears onward, and grinds
down, at high water, so that its current rolls only gravel at its
confluence with the Rhone."<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>

<p>Guglielmini argued that the gravel and sand of the beds
of running streams were derived from the trituration of rocks
by the action of the currents, and inferred that this action was
generally sufficient to reduce hard rock to sand in its passage
from the source to the outlet of rivers. Frisi controverted this
opinion, and maintained that river sand was of more ancient
origin, and he inferred from experiments in artificially grinding
stones that the concussion, friction, and attrition of rock in the
channel of running waters were inadequate to its comminution,
though he admitted that these same causes might reduce silicious
sand to a fine powder capable of transportation to the
sea by the currents.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Frisi's experiments were tried upon
rounded and polished river pebbles, and prove nothing with
regard to the action of torrents upon the irregular, more or
less weathered, and often cracked and shattered rocks which
lie loose in the ground at the head of mountain valleys. The
fury of the waters and of the wind which accompanies them
in the floods of the French Alpine torrents is such, that large
blocks of stone are hurled out of the bed of the stream to
the height of twelve or thirteen feet. The impulse of masses
driven with such force overthrows the most solid masonry,
and their concussion cannot fail to be attended with the crushing
of the rocks themselves.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>


<h4>d. <i>Inundations of 1856 in France.</i></h4>

<p>The month of May, 1856, was remarkable for violent and
almost uninterrupted rains, and most of the river basins of
France were inundated to an extraordinary height. In the
valleys of the Loire and its affluents, about a million of acres,
including many towns and villages, were laid under water,
and the amount of pecuniary damage was almost incalculable.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
The flood was not less destructive in the valley of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
the Rhone, and in fact an invasion by a hostile army could
hardly have been more disastrous to the inhabitants of the
plains than was this terrible deluge. There had been a flood
of this latter river in the year 1840, which, for height and
quantity of water, was almost as remarkable as that of 1856,
but it took place in the month of November, when the crops
had all been harvested, and the injury inflicted by it upon
agriculturists was, therefore, of a character to be less severely
and less immediately felt than the consequences of the inundation
of 1856.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>In the fifteen years between these two great floods, the
population and the rural improvements of the river valleys
had much increased, common roads, bridges, and railways had
been multiplied and extended, telegraph lines had been constructed,
all of which shared in the general ruin, and hence
greater and more diversified interests were affected by the
catastrophe of 1856 than by any former like calamity. The
great flood of 1840 had excited the attention and roused the
sympathies of the French people, and the subject was invested
with new interest by the still more formidable character of the
inundations of 1856. It was felt that these scourges had ceased
to be a matter of merely local concern, for, although they bore
most heavily on those whose homes and fields were situated
within the immediate reach of the swelling waters, yet they
frequently destroyed harvests valuable enough to be a matter
of national interest, endangered the personal security of the
population of important political centres, interrupted communication
for days and even weeks together on great lines of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
traffic and travel&mdash;thus severing as it were all Southwestern
France from the rest of the empire&mdash;and finally threatened to
produce great and permanent geographical changes. The
well-being of the whole commonwealth was seen to be involved
in preventing the recurrence, and in limiting the range
of such devastations. The Government encouraged scientific
investigation of the phenomena and their laws. Their causes,
their history, their immediate and remote consequences, and
the possible safeguards to be employed against them, have
been carefully studied by the most eminent physicists, as well
as by the ablest theoretical and practical engineers of France.
Many hitherto unobserved facts have been collected, many
new hypotheses suggested, and many plans, more or less original
in character, have been devised for combating the evil;
but thus far, the most competent judges are not well agreed as
to the mode, or even the possibility, of applying a remedy.</p>


<h4>e. <i>Remedies against Inundations.</i></h4>

<p>Perhaps no one point has been more prominent in the discussions
than the influence of the forest in equalizing and
regulating the flow of the water of precipitation. As we have
already seen, opinion is still somewhat divided on this subject,
but the conservative action of the woods in this respect has
been generally recognized by the public of France, and the
Government of the empire has made this principle the basis of
important legislation for the protection of existing forests, and
for the formation of new. The clearing of woodland, and the
organization and functions of a police for its protection, are
regulated by a law bearing date June 18th, 1859, and provision
was made for promoting the restoration of private
woods by a statute adopted on the 28th of July, 1860. The
former of these laws passed the legislative body by a vote of
246 against 4, the latter with but a single negative voice.
The influence of the government, in a country where the throne
is so potent as in France, would account for a large majority,
but when it is considered that both laws, the former especially,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
interfere very materially with the rights of private domain,
the almost entire unanimity with which they were adopted is
proof of a very general popular conviction, that the protection
and extension of the forests is a measure more likely than any
other to check the violence, if not to prevent the recurrence, of
destructive inundations. The law of July 28th, 1860, appropriated
10,000,000 francs, to be expended, at the rate of 1,000,000
francs per year, in executing or aiding the replanting of woods.
It is computed that this appropriation will secure the creation
of new forest to the extent of about 250,000 acres, or one eleventh
part of the soil where the restoration of the forest is
thought feasible and, at the same time, specially important as
a security against the evils ascribed in a great measure to its
destruction.</p>

<p>The provisions of the laws in question are preventive rather
than remedial; but some immediate effect may be expected to
result from them, particularly if they are accompanied with
certain other measures, the suggestion of which has been
favorably received. The strong repugnance of the mountaineers
to the application of a system which deprives them
of a part of their pasturage&mdash;for the absolute exclusion of
domestic animals is indispensable to the maintenance of an
existing forest and to the formation of a new&mdash;is the most
formidable obstacle to the execution of the laws of 1859-'60.
It is proposed to compensate this loss by a cheap system of
irrigation of lower pasture grounds, consisting in little more
than in running horizontal furrows along the hillsides, thus
converting the scarp of the hills into a succession of small terraces
which, when once turfed over, are very permanent.
Experience is said to have demonstrated that this simple process
suffices to retain the water of rains, of snows, and of small
springs and rivulets, long enough for the irrigation of the soil,
thus increasing its product of herbage in a fivefold proportion,
and that it partially checks the too rapid flow of surface water
into the valleys, and, consequently, in some measure obviates
one of the most prominent causes of inundations.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> It is evi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>dent
that, if such results are produced by this method, its introduction
upon an extensive scale must also have the same
climatic effects as other systems of irrigation.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the ultimate advantages of reclothing a
large extent of the territory of France with wood, or of so
shaping its surface as to prevent the too rapid flow of water
over it, the results to be obtained by such processes can be
realized in an adequate measure only after a long succession
of years. Other steps must be taken, both for the immediate
security of the lives and property of the present generation,
and for the prevention of yet greater and remoter evils which
are inevitable unless means to obviate them are found before
it is forever too late. The frequent recurrence of inundations
like those of 1856, for a single score of years, in the basins of
the Rhone and the Loire, with only the present securities
against them, would almost depopulate the valleys of those
rivers, and produce physical revolutions in them, which, like
revolutions in the political world, could never be made to "go
backward."</p>

<p>Destructive inundations are seldom, if ever, produced by
precipitation within the limits of the principal valley, but
almost uniformly by sudden thaws or excessive rains on the
mountain ranges where the tributaries take their rise. It is
therefore plain that any measures which shall check the flow
of surface waters into the channels of the affluents, or which
shall retard the delivery of such waters into the principal
stream by its tributaries, will diminish in the same proportion
the dangers and the evils of inundation by great rivers. The
retention of the surface waters upon or in the soil can hardly
be accomplished except by the methods already mentioned,
replanting of forests, and furrowing or terracing. The current
of mountain streams can be checked by various methods,
among which the most familiar and obvious is the erection of
barriers or dams across their channels, at points convenient for
forming reservoirs large enough to retain the superfluous
waters of great rains and thaws. Besides the utility of such
basins in preventing floods, the construction of them is recom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>mended
by very strong considerations, such as the meteorological
effects of increased evaporable surface, the furnishing
of a constant supply of water for agricultural and mechanical
purposes, and, finally, their value as ponds for breeding and
rearing fish, and, perhaps, for cultivating aquatic vegetables.</p>

<p>The objections to the general adoption of the system of
reservoirs are these: the expense of their construction and
maintenance; the reduction of cultivable area by the amount
of surface they must cover; the interruption they would occasion
to free communication; the probability that they would
soon be filled up with sediment, and the obvious fact that
when full of earth or even water, they would no longer serve
their principal purpose; the great danger to which they would
expose the country below them in case of the bursting of their
barriers;<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> the evil consequences they would occasion by prolonging
the flow of inundations in proportion as they diminished
their height; the injurious effects it is supposed they
would produce upon the salubrity of the neighboring districts;
and, lastly, the alleged impossibility of constructing artificial
basins sufficient in capacity to prevent, or in any considerable
measure to mitigate, the evils they are intended to guard
against.</p>

<p>The last argument is more easily reduced to a numerical
question than the others. The mean and extreme annual precipitation
of all the basins where the construction of such
works would be seriously proposed is already approximately
known by meteorological tables, and the quantity of water,
delivered by the greatest floods which have occurred within
the memory of man, may be roughly estimated from their
visible traces. From these elements, or from recorded observations,
the capacity of the necessary reservoirs can be calculated.
Let us take the case of the Ard&egrave;che. In the inundation
of 1857, that river poured into the Rhone 1,305,000,000
cubic yards of water in three days. If we suppose that half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
this quantity might have been suffered to flow down its channel
without inconvenience, we shall have about 650,000,000
cubic yards to provide for by reservoirs. The Ard&egrave;che and
its principal affluent, the Chassezac, have, together, about
twelve considerable tributaries rising near the crest of the
mountains which bound the basin. If reservoirs of equal
capacity were constructed upon all of them, each reservoir
must be able to contain 54,000,000 cubic yards, or, in other
words, must be equal to a lake 3,000 yards long, 1,000 yards
wide, and 18 yards deep, and besides, in order to render any
effectual service, the reservoirs must all have been empty at
the commencement of the rains which produced the inundation.</p>

<p>Thus far, I have supposed the swelling of the waters to be
uniform throughout the whole basin; but such was by no
means the fact in the inundation of 1857, for the rise of the
Chassezac, which is as large as the Ard&egrave;che proper, did not
exceed the limits of ordinary floods, and the dangerous excess
came solely from the headwaters of the latter stream. Hence
reservoirs of double the capacity I have supposed would have
been necessary upon the tributaries of that river, to prevent
the injurious effects of the inundation. It is evident that the
construction of reservoirs of such magnitude for such a purpose
is financially, if not physically, impracticable, and when we
take into account a point I have just suggested, namely, that
the reservoirs must be empty at all times of apprehended flood,
and, of course, their utility limited almost solely to the single
object of preventing inundations, the total inapplicability of
such a measure in this particular case becomes still more glaringly
manifest.</p>

<p>Another not less conclusive fact is that the valleys of all
the upland tributaries of the Ard&egrave;che descend so rapidly, and
have so little lateral expansion, as to render the construction
of capacious reservoirs in them quite impracticable. Indeed,
engineers have found but two points in the whole basin suitable
for that purpose, and the reservoirs admissible at these
would have only a joint capacity of about 70,000,000 cubic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
yards, or less than one ninth part of what I suppose to be
required. The case of the Ard&egrave;che is no doubt an extreme
one, both in the topographical character of its basin and in its
exposure to excessive rains; but all destructive inundations
are, in a certain sense, extreme cases also, and this of the
Ard&egrave;che serves to show that the construction of reservoirs is
not by any means to be regarded as a universal panacea
against floods.</p>

<p>Nor, on the other hand, is this measure to be summarily
rejected. Nature has adopted it on a great scale, on both
flanks of the Alps, and on a smaller, on those of the Adirondacks
and lower chains, and in this as in many other instances,
her processes may often be imitated with advantage. The
validity of the remaining objections to the system under discussion
depends on the topography, geology, and special climate
of the regions where it is proposed to establish such
reservoirs. Many upland streams present numerous points
where none of these objections, except those of expense and of
danger from the breaking of dams, could have any application.
Reservoirs may be so constructed as to retain the entire precipitation
of the heaviest thaws and rains, leaving only the
ordinary quantity to flow along the channel; they may be
raised to such a height as only partially to obstruct the surface
drainage; or they may be provided with sluices by means of
which their whole contents can be discharged in the dry season
and a summer crop be grown upon the ground they cover
at high water. The expediency of employing them and the
mode of construction depend on local conditions, and no rules
of universal applicability can be laid down on the subject.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that nations which we, in the false pride
of our modern civilization, so generally regard as little less
than barbarian, should have long preceded Christian Europe in
the systematic employment of great artificial basins for the
various purposes they are calculated to subserve. The ancient
Peruvians built strong walls, of excellent workmanship, across
the channels of the mountain sources of important streams,
and the Arabs executed immense works of similar description,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
both in the great Arabian peninsula and in all the provinces
of Spain which had the good fortune to fall under their sway.
The Spaniards of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, who, in
many points of true civilization and culture, were far inferior
to the races they subdued, wantonly destroyed these noble
monuments of social and political wisdom, or suffered them to
perish, because they were too ignorant to appreciate their
value, or too unskilful as practical engineers to be able to
maintain them, and some of their most important territories
were soon reduced to sterility and poverty in consequence.</p>

<p>Another method of preventing or diminishing the evils of
inundation by torrents and mountain rivers, analogous to that
employed for the drainage of lakes, consists in the permanent
or occasional diversion of their surplus waters, or of their entire
currents, from their natural courses, by tunnels or open channels
cut through their banks. Nature, in many cases, resorts
to a similar process. Most great rivers divide themselves into
several arms in their lower course, and enter the sea by different
mouths. There are also cases where rivers send off lateral
branches to convey a part of their waters into the channel
of other streams.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> The most remarkable of these is the junction
between the Amazon and the Orinoco by the natural
canal of the Cassiquiare and the Rio Negro. In India, the
Cambodja and the Menam are connected by the Anam; the
Saluen and the Irawaddi by the Panlaun. There are similar
examples, though on a much smaller scale, in Europe. The
Torne&aring; and the Calix rivers in Lapland communicate by the
Tarando, and in Westphalia, the Else, an arm of the Haase,
falls into the Weser.</p>

<p>The change of bed in rivers by gradual erosion of their
banks is familiar to all, but instances of the sudden abandonment
of a primitive channel are by no means wanting. At a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
period of unknown antiquity, the Ard&egrave;che pierced a tunnel
200 feet wide and 100 high, through a rock, and sent its whole
current through it, deserting its former bed, which gradually
filled up, though its course remained traceable. In the great
inundation of 1827, the tunnel proved insufficient for the discharge
of the water, and the river burst through the obstructions
which had now choked up its ancient channel, and resumed
its original course.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>It was probably such facts as these that suggested to
ancient engineers the possibility of like artificial operations,
and there are numerous instances of the execution of works for
this purpose in very remote ages. The Bahr Jusef, the great
stream which supplies the Fayoum with water from the Nile,
has been supposed, by some writers, to be a natural channel;
but both it and the Bahr el Wady are almost certainly artificial
canals constructed to water that basin, to regulate the
level of Lake Moeris, and possibly, also, to diminish the dangers
resulting from excessive inundations of the Nile, by serving
as waste-weirs to discharge a part of its surplus waters.
Several of the seven ancient mouths of the Nile are believed
to be artificial channels, and Herodotus even asserts that King
Menes diverted the entire course of that river from the Libyan
to the Arabian side of the valley. There are traces of an
ancient river bed along the western mountains, which give
some countenance to this statement. But it is much more
probable that the works of Menes were designed rather to
prevent a natural, than to produce an artificial, change in the
channel of the river.</p>

<p>Two of the most celebrated cascades in Europe, those of
the Teverone at Tivoli and of the Velino at Terni, owe, if not
their existence, at least their position and character, to the
diversion of their waters from their natural beds into new
channels, in order to obviate the evils produced by their frequent
floods. Remarkable works of the same sort have been
executed in Switzerland, in very recent times. Until the year<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
1714, the Kander, which drains several large Alpine valleys,
ran, for a considerable distance, parallel with the Lake of
Thun, and a few miles below the city of that name emptied
into the river Aar. It frequently flooded the flats along the
lower part of its course, and it was determined to divert it into
the Lake of Thun. For this purpose, two parallel tunnels
were cut through the intervening rock, and the river turned
into them. The violence of the current burst up the roof of
the tunnels, and, in a very short time, wore the new channel
down not less than one hundred feet, and even deepened the
former bed at least fifty feet, for a distance of two or three
miles above the tunnel. The lake was two hundred feet deep
at the point where the river was conducted into it, but the
gravel and sand carried down by the Kander has formed at its
mouth a delta containing more than a hundred acres, which is
still advancing at the rate of several yards a year. The Linth,
which formerly sent its waters directly to the Lake of Zurich,
and often produced very destructive inundations, was turned
into the Wallensee about forty years ago, and in both these
cases a great quantity of valuable land was rescued both from
flood and from insalubrity.</p>

<p>In Switzerland, the most terrible inundations often result
from the damming up of deep valleys by ice slips or by the
gradual advance of glaciers, and the accumulation of great
masses of water above the obstructions. The ice is finally dissolved
by the heat of summer or the flow of warm waters, and
when it bursts, the lake formed above is discharged almost in
an instant, and all below is swept down to certain destruction.
In 1595, about a hundred and fifty lives and a great amount
of property were lost by the eruption of a lake formed by the
descent of a glacier into the valley of the Drance, and a similar
calamity laid waste a considerable extent of soil in the
year 1818. On this latter occasion, the barrier of ice and
snow was 3,000 feet long, 600 thick, and 400 high, and the
lake which had formed above it contained not less than
800,000,000 cubic feet. A tunnel was driven through the ice,
and about 300,000,000 cubic feet of water safely drawn off by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
it, but the thawing of the walls of the tunnel rapidly enlarged
it, and before the lake was half drained, the barrier gave way
and the remaining 500,000,000 cubic feet of water were discharged
in half an hour. The recurrence of these floods has
since been prevented by directing streams of water, warmed
by the sun, upon the ice in the bed of the valley, and thus
thawing it before it accumulates in sufficient mass to threaten
serious danger.</p>

<p>In the cases of diversion of streams above mentioned, important
geographical changes have been directly produced by
those operations. By the rarer process of draining glacier
lakes, natural eruptions of water, which would have occasioned
not less important changes in the face of the earth, have been
prevented by human agency.</p>

<p>The principal means hitherto relied upon for defence
against river inundations has been the construction of dikes
along the banks of the streams, parallel to the channel and
generally separated from each other by a distance not much
greater than the natural width of the bed.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> If such walls are
high enough to confine the water and strong enough to resist
its pressure, they secure the lands behind them from all the
evils of inundation except those resulting from infiltration;
but such ramparts are enormously costly in original construction
and maintenance, and, as we have already seen, the filling
up of the bed of the river in its lower course, by sand and
gravel, involves the necessity of occasionally incurring new
expenditures in increasing the height of the banks.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
are attended, too, with some collateral disadvantages. They
deprive the earth of the fertilizing deposits of the waters,
which are powerful natural restoratives of soils exhausted by
cultivation; they accelerate the rapidity and transporting
power of the current at high water by confining it to a narrower
channel, and it consequently conveys to the sea the
earthy matter it holds in suspension, and chokes up harbors
with a deposit which it would otherwise have spread over a
wide surface; they interfere with roads and the convenience
of river navigation, and no amount of cost or care can secure
them from occasional rupture, in case of which the rush of the
waters through the breach is more destructive than the natural
flow of the highest inundation.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>For these reasons, many experienced engineers are of
opinion that the system of longitudinal dikes ought to be
abandoned, or, where that cannot be done without involving
too great a sacrifice of existing constructions, their elevation
should be much reduced, so as to present no obstruction to the
lateral spread of extraordinary floods, and they should be provided
with sluices to admit the water without violence whenever
they are likely to be overflowed. Where dikes have not
been erected, and where they have been reduced in height, it
is proposed to construct, at convenient intervals, transverse
embankments of moderate height running from the banks of
the river across the plains to the hills which bound them.
These measures, it is argued, will diminish the violence of
inundations by permitting the waters to extend themselves
over a greater surface and thus retarding the flow of the river
currents, and will, at the same time, secure the deposit of fertilizing
slime upon all the soil covered by the flood.</p>

<p>Rozet, an eminent French engineer, has proposed a method
of diminishing the ravages of inundations, which aims to combine
the advantages of all other systems, and at the same time
to obviate the objections to which they are all more or less
liable.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> The plan of Rozet is recommended by its simplicity
and cheapness as well as its facility and rapidity of execution,
and is looked upon with favor by many persons very competent
to judge in such matters. He proposes to commence with
the amphitheatres in which mountain torrents so often rise, by
covering their slopes and filling their beds with loose blocks
of rock, and by constructing at their outlets, and at other narrow
points in the channels of the torrents, permeable barriers
of the same material promiscuously heaped up, much according
to the method employed by the ancient Romans in their
northern provinces for a similar purpose. By this means, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
supposes, the rapidity of the current would be checked, and the
quantity of transported pebbles and gravel much diminished.</p>

<p>When the stream has reached that part of its course where
it is bordered by soil capable of cultivation, and worth the
expense of protection, he proposes to place along one or both
sides of the stream, according to circumstances, a line of cubical
blocks of stone or pillars of masonry three or four feet high
and wide, and at the distance of about eleven yards from each
other. The space between the two lines, or between a line and
the opposite high bank, would, of course, be determined by
observation of the width of the swift-water current at high
floods. As an auxiliary measure, small ditches and banks, or
low walls of pebbles, should be constructed from the line of
blocks across the grounds to be protected, nearly at right
angles to the current, but slightly inclining downward, and at
convenient distances from each other. Rozet thinks the proper
interval would be 300 yards, and it is evident that, if he is
right in his main principle, hedges, rows of trees, or even
common fences, would in many cases answer as good a purpose
as banks and trenches or low walls. The blocks or pillars
of stone would, he contends, check the lateral currents so as to
compel them to let fall all their pebbles and gravel in the main
channel&mdash;where they would be rolled along until ground down
to sand or silt&mdash;and the transverse obstructions would detain
the water upon the soil long enough to secure the deposit of
its fertilizing slime. Numerous facts are cited in support of
the author's views, and I imagine there are few residents of
rural districts whose own observation will not furnish testimony
confirmatory of their soundness.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>

<p>The deposit of slime by rivers upon the flats along their
banks not only contributes greatly to the fertility of the soil
thus flowed, but it subserves a still more important purpose in
the general economy of nature. All running streams begin
with excavating channels for themselves, or deepening the
natural depressions in which they flow;<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> but in proportion as
their outlets are raised by the solid material transported by
their currents, their velocity is diminished, they deposit gravel
and sand at constantly higher and higher points, and so at last
elevate, in the middle and lower part of their course, the beds
they had previously scooped out.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> The raising of the chan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>nels
is compensated in part by the simultaneous elevation of
their banks and the flats adjoining them, from the deposit of
the finer particles of earth and vegetable mould brought down
from the mountains, without which elevation the low grounds
bordering all rivers would be, as in many cases they in fact
are, mere morasses.</p>

<p>All arrangements which tend to obstruct this process of
raising the flats adjacent to the channel, whether consisting in
dikes which confine the waters, and, at the same time, augment
the velocity of the current, or in other means of producing
the last-mentioned effect, interfere with the restorative
economy of nature, and at last occasion the formation of
marshes where, if left to herself, she would have accumulated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
inexhaustible stores of the richest soil, and spread them out in
plains above the reach of ordinary floods.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>


<h4><i>Consequences if the Nile had been Diked.</i></h4>

<p>If a system of continuous lateral dikes, like those of the Po,
had been adopted in Egypt in the early dynasties, when the
power and the will to undertake the most stupendous material
enterprises were so eminently characteristic of the government
of that country, and the waters of the annual inundation consequently
prevented from flooding the land, it is conceivable
that the productiveness of the small area of cultivable soil in
the Nile valley might have been long kept up by artificial irrigation
and the application of manures. But nature would
have rebelled at last, and centuries before our time the mighty
river would have burst the fetters by which impotent man had
vainly striven to bind his swelling floods, the fertile fields of
Egypt would have been converted into dank morasses, and
then, perhaps, in some distant future, when the expulsion of
man should have allowed the gradual restoration of the primitive
equilibrium, would be again transformed into luxuriant
garden and plough land. Fortunately, the "wisdom of Egypt"
taught her children better things. They invited and welcomed,
not repulsed, the slimy embraces of Nilus, and his favors have
been, from the hoariest antiquity, the greatest material blessing
ever bestowed upon a people.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span></p>

<p>The valley of the Po has probably not been cultivated or
inhabited so long as that of the Nile, but embankments have
been employed on its lower course for at least two thousand
years, and for many centuries they have been connected in a
continuous chain. I have pointed out in a former chapter the
effects produced on the geography of the Adriatic by the deposit
of river sediment in the sea at the mouths of the Po, the
Adige, and the Brenta. If these rivers had been left unconfined,
like the Nile, and allowed to spread their muddy waters
at will, according to the laws of nature, the slime they have
carried to the coast would have been chiefly distributed over the
plains of Lombardy. Their banks would have risen as fast as
their beds, the coast line would not have been extended so far
into the Adriatic, and, the current of the streams being consequently
shorter, the inclination of their channel and the
rapidity of their flow would not have been so greatly diminished.
Had man spared a reasonable proportion of the forests
of the Alps, and not attempted to control the natural drainage
of the surface, the Po would resemble the Nile in all its essential
characteristics, and, in spite of the difference of climate,
perhaps be regarded as the friend and ally, not the enemy and
the invader, of the population which dwells upon its banks.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span></p>

<p>The Nile is larger than all the rivers of Lombardy together,<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>
it drains a basin twenty times as extensive, its banks
have been occupied by man probably twice as long. But its
geographical character has not been much changed in the
whole period of recorded history, and, though its outlets have
somewhat fluctuated in number and position, its historically
known encroachments upon the sea are trifling compared with
those of the Po and the neighboring streams. The deposits of
the Nile are naturally greater in Upper than in Lower Egypt.
They are found to have raised the soil at Thebes about seven
feet within the last seventeen hundred years, and in the Delta
the rise has been certainly more than half as great.</p>

<p>We shall, therefore, not exceed the truth if we suppose the
annually inundated surface of Egypt to have been elevated,
upon an average, ten feet, within the last 5,000 years, or twice
and a half the period during which the history of the Po is
known to us.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>We may estimate the present actually cultivated area of
Egypt at about 5,500 square statute miles. As I have computed
in a note on page 372, that area is not more than half
as extensive as under the dynasties of the Pharaohs and the
Ptolemies; for&mdash;though, in consequence of the elevation of
the river bed, the inundations now have a wider <i>natural</i>
spread&mdash;the industry of the ancient Egyptians conducted the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
Nile water over a great extent of soil it does not now reach.
We may, then, adopt a mean between the two quantities, and
we shall probably come near the truth if we assume the convenient
number of 7,920 square statute miles as the average
measure of the inundated land during the historical period.
Taking the deposit on this surface at ten feet, the river sediment
let fall on the soil of Egypt within the last fifty centuries
would amount to fifteen cubic miles.</p>

<p>Had the Nile been banked in, like the Po, all this deposit,
except that contained in the water diverted by canals or otherwise
drawn from the river for irrigation and other purposes,
would have been carried out to sea.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> This would have been
a considerable quantity; for the Nile holds earth in suspension
even at low water, a much larger proportion during the
flood, and irrigation must have been carried on during the
whole year. The precise amount which would have been thus
distributed over the soil is matter of conjecture, but three
cubic miles is certainly a liberal estimate. This would leave
twelve cubic miles as the quantity which embankments would
have compelled the Nile to transport to the Mediterranean over
and above what it has actually deposited in that sea. The
Mediterranean is shoal for some miles out to sea along the
whole coast of the Delta, and the large bays or lagoons within
the coast line, which communicate both with the river and the
sea, have little depth of water. These lagoons the river deposits
would have filled up, and there would still have been surplus
earth enough to extend the Delta far into the Mediterranean.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Deposits of the Tuscan Rivers.</i></h4>

<p>The Arno, and all the rivers rising on the western slopes
and spurs of the Apennines, carry down immense quantities
of mud to the Mediterranean. There can be no doubt that the
volume of earth so transported is very much greater than it
would have been had the soil about the headwaters of those
rivers continued to be protected from wash by forests; and
there is as little question that the quantity borne out to sea
by the rivers of Western Italy is much increased by artificial
embankments, because they are thereby prevented from
spreading over the surface the sedimentary matter with which
they are charged. The western coast of Tuscany has advanced
some miles seaward within a very few centuries. The bed of
the sea, for a long distance, has been raised, and of course the
relative elevation of the land above it lessened; harbors have
been filled up and destroyed; long lines of coast dunes have
been formed, and the diminished inclination of the beds of the
rivers near their outlets has caused their waters to overflow
their banks and convert them into pestilential marshes. The
territorial extent of Western Italy has thus been considerably
increased, but the amount of soil habitable and cultivable by
man has been, in a still higher proportion, diminished. The
coast of ancient Etruria was filled with great commercial
towns, and their rural environs were occupied by a large and
prosperous population. But maritime Tuscany has long been
one of the most unhealthy districts in Christendom; the
famous mart of Populonia has not an inhabitant; the coast is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
almost absolutely depopulated, and the malarious fevers have
extended their ravages far into the interior.</p>

<p>These results are certainly not to be ascribed wholly to
human action. They are, in a large proportion, due to geological
causes over which man has no control. The soil of
much of Tuscany becomes pasty, almost fluid even, as soon as
it is moistened, and when thoroughly saturated with water, it
flows like a river. Such a soil as this would not be completely
protected by woods, and, indeed, it would now be difficult to
confine it long enough to allow it to cover itself with forest
vegetation. Nevertheless, it certainly was once chiefly wooded,
and the rivers which flow through it must then have been
much less charged with earthy matter than at present, and
they must have carried into the sea a smaller proportion of
their sediment when they were free to deposit it on their banks
than since they have been confined by dikes.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p>

<p>It is, in general, true, that the intervention of man has
hitherto seemed to insure the final exhaustion, ruin, and desolation
of every province of nature which he has reduced to his
dominion. Attila was only giving an energetic and picturesque
expression to the tendencies of human action, as personified
in himself, when he said that "no grass grew where
his horse's hoofs had trod." The instances are few, where a
second civilization has flourished upon the ruins of an ancient
culture, and lands once rendered uninhabitable by human acts
or neglect have generally been forever abandoned as hopelessly
irreclaimable. It is, as I have before remarked, a question
of vast importance, how far it is practicable to restore the
garden we have wasted, and it is a problem on which experience
throws little light, because few deliberate attempts have
yet been made at the work of physical regeneration, on a scale
large enough to warrant general conclusions in any one class
of cases.</p>

<p>The valleys and shores of Tuscany form, however, a striking
exception to this remark. The success with which human
guidance has made the operations of nature herself available
for the restoration of her disturbed harmonies, in the Val di
Chiana and the Tuscan Maremma, is among the noblest, if not
the most brilliant achievements of modern engineering, and,
regarded in all its bearings on the great question of which I
have just spoken, it is, as an example, of more importance to
the general interests of humanity than the proudest work of
internal improvement that mechanical means have yet constructed.
The operations in the Val di Chiana have consisted
chiefly in so regulating the flow of the surface waters into and
through it, as to compel them to deposit their sedimentary
matter at the will of the engineers, and thereby to raise
grounds rendered insalubrious and unfit for agricultural use
by stagnating water; the improvements in the Maremma have
embraced both this method of elevating the level of the soil,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
and the prevention of the mixture of salt water with fresh in
the coast marshes and shallow bays, which is a very active
cause of the development of malarious influences.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>


<h4><i>Improvements in the Val di Chiana.</i></h4>

<p>For twenty miles or more after the remotest headwaters of
the Arno have united to form a considerable stream, this river
flows southeastward to the vicinity of Arezzo. It here sweeps
round to the northwest, and follows that course to near its
junction with the Sieve, a few miles above Florence, from
which point its general direction is westward to the sea. From
the bend at Arezzo, a depression called the Val di Chiana runs
southeastward until it strikes into the valley of the Paglia, a
tributary of the Tiber, and thus connects the basin of the latter
river with that of the Arno. In the Middle Ages, and down to
the eighteenth century, the Val di Chiana was often overflowed
and devastated by the torrents which poured down
from the highlands, transporting great quantities of slime with
their currents, stagnating upon its surface, and gradually converting
it into a marshy and unhealthy district, which was at
last very greatly reduced in population and productiveness.
It had, in fact, become so desolate that even the swallow had
deserted it.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>

<p>The bed of the Arno near Arezzo and that of the Paglia at
the southern extremity of the Val di Chiana did not differ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
much in level. The general inclination of the valley was
therefore small; it does not appear to have ever been divided
into opposite slopes by a true watershed, and the position of
the summit seems to have shifted according to the varying
amount and place of deposit of the sediment brought down
by the lateral streams which emptied into it. The length of
its principal channel of drainage, and even the direction of its
flow at any given point, were therefore fluctuating. Hence,
much difference of opinion was entertained at different times
with regard to the normal course of this stream, and, consequently,
to the question whether it was to be regarded as properly
an affluent of the Tiber or of the Arno.</p>

<p>The bed of the latter river at the bend has been eroded to
the depth of thirty or forty feet, and that, apparently, at no
very remote period. If it were elevated to what was evidently
its original height, the current of the Arno would be so much
above that of the Paglia as to allow of a regular flow from its
channel to the latter stream, through the Val di Chiana, provided
the bed of the valley had remained at the level which
excavations prove it to have had a few centuries ago, before it
was raised by the deposits I have mentioned. These facts,
together with the testimony of ancient geographers which
scarcely admits of any other explanation, are thought to prove
that all the waters of the Upper Arno were originally discharged
through the Val di Chiana into the Tiber, and that a
part of them still continued to flow, at least occasionally, in
that direction down to the days of the Roman empire, and
perhaps for some time later. The depression of the bed of the
Arno, and the raising of that of the valley by the deposits of
the lateral torrents and of the Arno itself, finally cut off the
branch of the river which had flowed to the Tiber, and all its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
waters were turned into its present channel, though the principal
drainage of the Val di Chiana appears to have been in a
southeastwardly direction until within a comparatively recent
period.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century, the elevation of the bed of the
valley had become so considerable, that in 1551, at a point
about ten miles south of the Arno, it was found to be not less
than one hundred and thirty feet above that river; then followed
a level of ten miles, and then a continuous descent to
the Paglia. Along the level portion of the valley was a boatable
channel, and lakes, sometimes a mile or even two miles
in breadth, had formed at various points farther south. At
this period, the drainage of the summit level might easily
have been determined in either direction, and the opposite
descents of the valley made to culminate at the north or at the
south end of the level. In the former case, the watershed
would have been ten miles south of the Arno; in the latter,
twenty miles, and the division would have been not very
unequal.</p>

<p>Various schemes were suggested at this time for drawing
off the stagnant waters, as well as for the future regular drainage
of the valley, and small operations for those purposes were
undertaken with partial success; but it was feared that the
discharge of the accumulated waters into the Tiber would produce
a dangerous inundation, while the diversion of the drainage
into the Arno would increase the violence of the floods to
which that river was very subject, and no decisive steps were
taken. In 1606, an engineer whose name has not been preserved
proposed, as the only possible method of improvement,
the piercing of a tunnel through the hills bounding the valley
on the west to convey its waters to the Ombrone, but the
expense and other objections prevented the adoption of this
project.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> The fears of the Roman Government for the security
of the valley of the Tiber had induced it to construct barriers
across that part of the channel which lay within its territory,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
and these obstructions, though not specifically intended for
that purpose, naturally promoted the deposit of sediment and
the elevation of the bed of the valley in their neighborhood.
The effect of this measure and of the continued spontaneous
action of the torrents was, that the northern slope, which in
1551 had commenced at the distance of ten miles from the
Arno, was found in 1605 to begin, nearly thirty miles south of
that river, and in 1645 it had been removed about six miles
farther in the same direction.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>In the seventeenth century, the Tuscan and Papal Governments
consulted Galileo, Torricelli, Castelli, Cassini, Viviani,
and other distinguished philosophers and engineers, on the possibility
of reclaiming the valley by a regular artificial drainage.
Most of these eminent physicists were of opinion that the
measure was impracticable, though not altogether for the same
reasons; but they seem to have agreed in thinking that the
opening of such channels, in either direction, as would give the
current a flow sufficiently rapid to drain the lands properly,
would dangerously augment the inundations of the river&mdash;whether
the Tiber or the Arno&mdash;into which the waters should
be turned. The general improvement of the valley was now
for a long time abandoned, and the waters were allowed to
spread and stagnate until carried off by partial drainage, infiltration,
and evaporation. Torricelli had contended that the
slope of a large part of the valley was too small to allow it to
be drained by ordinary methods, and that no practicable depth
and width of canal would suffice for that purpose. It could
be laid dry, he thought, only by converting its surface into an
inclined plane, and he suggested that this might be accomplished
by controlling the flow of the numerous torrents which
pour into it, so as to force them to deposit their sediment at
the pleasure of the engineer, and, consequently, to elevate the
level of the area over which it should be spread.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> This plan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
did not meet with immediate general acceptance, but it was
soon adopted for local purposes at some points in the southern
part of the valley, and it gradually grew in public favor and
was extended in application until its final triumph a hundred
years later.</p>

<p>In spite of these encouraging successes, however, the fear
of danger to the valley of the Arno and the Tiber, and the
difficulty of an agreement between Tuscany and Rome&mdash;the
boundary between which states crossed the Val di Chiana not
far from the halfway point between the two rivers&mdash;and of
reconciling other conflicting interests, prevented the resumption
of the projects for the general drainage of the valley until
after the middle of the eighteenth century. In the mean time
the science of hydraulics had become better understood, and
the establishment of the natural law according to which the
velocity of a current of water, and of course the proportional
quantity discharged by it in a given time, are increased by
increasing its mass, had diminished if not dissipated the fear
of exposing the banks of the Arno to greater danger from
inundations by draining the Val di Chiana into it.</p>

<p>The suggestion of Torricelli was finally adopted as the basis
of a comprehensive system of improvement, and it was decided
to continue and extend the inversion of the original flow of the
waters, and to turn them into the Arno from a point as far to
the south as should be found practicable. The conduct of the
works was committed to a succession of able engineers who,
for a long series of years, were under the general direction of
the celebrated philosopher and statesman Fossombroni, and the
success has fully justified the expectations of the most sanguine
advocates of the scheme. The plan of improvement embraced
two branches: the one, the removal of certain obstructions in
the bed of the Arno, and, consequently, the further depression
of the channel of that river, in certain places, with the view<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
of increasing the rapidity of its current; the other, the gradual
filling up of the ponds and swamps, and raising of the lower
grounds of the Val di Chiana, by directing to convenient
points the flow of the streams which pour down into it, and
there confining their waters by temporary dams until the sediment
was deposited where it was needed. The economical
result of these operations has been, that in 1835 an area of
more than four hundred and fifty square miles of pond, marsh,
and damp, sickly low grounds had been converted into fertile,
healthy and well-drained soil, and, consequently, that so
much territory has been added to the agricultural domain
of Tuscany.</p>

<p>But in our present view of the subject, the geographical
revolution which has been accomplished is still more interesting.
The climatic influence of the elevation and draining of
the soil must have been considerable, though I do not know
that an increase or a diminution of the mean temperature or
precipitation in the valley has been established by meteorological
observation. There is, however, in the improvement
of the sanitary condition of the Val di Chiana, which was formerly
extremely unhealthy, satisfactory proof of a beneficial
climatic change. The fevers, which not only decimated the
population of the low grounds but infested the adjacent hills,
have ceased their ravages, and are now not more frequent than
in other parts of Tuscany. The strictly topographical effect
of the operations in question, besides the conversion of marsh
into dry surface, has been the inversion of the inclination of
the valley for a distance of thirty-five miles, so that this great
plain which, within a comparatively short period, sloped and
drained its waters to the south, now inclines and sends its
drainage to the north. The reversal of the currents of the
valley has added to the Arno a new tributary equal to the
largest of its former affluents, and a most important circumstance
connected with this latter fact is, that the increase of
the volume of its waters has accelerated their velocity in a still
greater proportion, and, instead of augmenting the danger from
its inundations, has almost wholly obviated that source of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
apprehension. Between the beginning of the fifteenth century
and the year 1761, thirty-one destructive floods of the Arno
are recorded; between 1761, when the principal streams of the
Val di Chiana were diverted into that river, and 1835, not
one.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>


<h4><i>Improvements in the Tuscan Maremme.</i></h4>

<p>In the improvements of the Tuscan Maremma, more formidable
difficulties have been encountered. The territory to be
reclaimed was more extensive; the salubrious places of retreat
for laborers and inspectors were more remote; the courses of
the rivers to be controlled were longer and their natural inclination
less rapid; some of them, rising in wooded regions,
transported comparatively little earthy matter,<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> and above all,</p>

<p>A like example is observed in the Anapus near Syracuse, which, below
the junction of its two branches, is narrower, though swifter than either
of them, and such cases are by no means unfrequent. The immediate
effect of the confluence of two rivers upon the current below depends
upon local circumstances, and especially upon the angle of incidence.
If the two nearly coincide in direction, so as to include a small angle, the
joint current will have a greater velocity than the slower confluent, perhaps
even than either of them. If the two rivers run in transverse, still
more if they flow in more or less opposite directions, the velocity of the
principal branch will be retarded both above and below the junction, and
at high water it may even set back the current of the affluent.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the diversion of a considerable branch from a river
retards its velocity below the point of separation, and here a deposit of
earth in its channel immediately begins, which has a tendency to turn the
whole stream into the new bed. "Theory and the authority of all hydrographical
writers combine to show that the channels of rivers undergo an
elevation of bed below a canal of diversion."&mdash;Letter of <span class="smcap">Fossombroni</span>, in
<span class="smcap">Salvagnoli</span>, <i>Raccolta di Documenti</i>, p. 32. See the early authorities and discussions
on the principle stated in the text, in <span class="smcap">Frisi</span>, <i>Del modo di regolare i
Fiumi e i Torrenti</i>, libro iii, capit. i.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
the coast, which is a recent deposit of the waters, is little
elevated above the sea, and admits into its lagoons and the
mouths of its rivers floods of salt water with every western
wind, every rising tide.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>The western coast of Tuscany is not supposed to have been
an unhealthy region before the conquest of Etruria by the
Romans, but it certainly became so within a few centuries
after that event. This was a natural consequence of the neglect
or wanton destruction of the public improvements, and
especially the hydraulic works in which the Etruscans were so
skilful, and of the felling of the upland forests, to satisfy the
demand for wood at Rome for domestic, industrial, and military
purposes. After the downfall of the Roman empire, the
incursions of the barbarians, and then feudalism, foreign domination,
intestine wars, and temporal and spiritual tyrannies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
aggravated still more cruelly the moral and physical evils
which Tuscany and the other Italian States were doomed to
suffer, and from which they have enjoyed but brief respites
during the whole period of modern history. The Maremma
was already proverbially unhealthy in the time of Dante, who
refers to the fact in several familiar passages, and the petty
tyrants upon its borders often sent criminals to places of confinement
in its territory, as a slow but certain mode of execution.
Ignorance of the causes of the insalubrity, and often the
interference of private rights,<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> prevented the adoption of measures
to remove it, and the growing political and commercial
importance of the large towns in more healthful localities
absorbed the attention of Government, and deprived the Maremma
of its just share in the systems of physical improvement
which were successfully adopted in interior and Northern Italy.</p>

<p>Before any serious attempts were made to drain or fill up
the marshes of the Maremme, various other sanitary experiments
were tried. It was generally believed that the insalubrity
of the province was the consequence, not the cause,
of its depopulation, and that, if it were once densely inhabited,
the ordinary operations of agriculture, and especially the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
maintenance of numerous domestic fires, would restore it to its
ancient healthfulness.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> In accordance with these views, settlers
were invited from various parts of Italy, from Greece,
and, after the accession of the Lorraine princes, from that
country also, and colonized in the Maremme. To strangers
coming from soils and skies so unlike those of the Tuscan
marshes, the climate was more fatal than to the inhabitants of
the neighboring districts, whose constitutions had become in
some degree inured to the local influences, or who at least
knew better how to guard against them. The consequence
very naturally was that the experiment totally failed to produce
the desired effects, and was attended with a great sacrifice
of life and a heavy loss to the treasury of the state.</p>

<p>The territory known as the Tuscan Maremma, <i>ora maritima</i>,
or Maremme&mdash;for the plural form is most generally used&mdash;lies
upon and near the western coast of Tuscany, and comprises
about 1,900 square miles English, of which 500 square
miles, or 320,000 acres, are plain and marsh including 45,500
acres of water surface, and about 290,000 acres are forest.
One of the mountain peaks, that of Mount Amiata, rises to the
height of 6,280 feet. The mountains of the Maremma are
healthy, the lower hills much less so, as the malaria is felt at
some points at the height of 1,000 feet, and the plains, with
the exception of a few localities favorably situated on the seacoast,
are in a high degree pestilential. The fixed population
is about 80,000, of whom one sixth live on the plains in the
winter and about one tenth in the summer. Nine or ten thousand
laborers come down from the mountains of the Maremma
and the neighboring provinces into the plain, during the latter
season, to cultivate and gather the crops.</p>

<p>Out of this small number of inhabitants and strangers,
35,619 were ill enough to require medical treatment between
the 1st of June, 1840, and the 1st of June, 1841, and more
than one half the cases were of intermittent, malignant, gas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>tric,
or catarrhal fever. Very few agricultural laborers escaped
fever, though the disease did not always manifest itself until
they had returned to the mountains. In the province of Grosseto,
which embraces nearly the whole of the Maremma, the
annual mortality was 3.92 per cent. the average duration of
life but 23.18 years, and 75 per cent. of the deaths were among
persons engaged in agriculture.</p>

<p>The filling up of the low grounds and the partial separation
of the waters of the sea and the land, which had been in
progress since the year 1827, now began to show very decided
effects upon the sanitary condition of the population. In the
year ending June 1st, 1842, the number of the sick was reduced
by more than 2,000, and the cases of fever by more than
4,000. The next year, the cases of fever fell to 10,500, and in
that ending June 1st, 1844, to 9,200. The political events of
1848 and the preceding and following years, occasioned the
suspension of the works of improvement in the Maremma, but
they were resumed after the revolution of 1859, and are now
in successful progress.</p>

<p>I have spoken, with some detail, of the improvements in
the Val di Chiana and the Tuscan Maremma, because of their
great relative importance, and because their history is well
known; but like operations have been executed in the territory
of Pisa and upon the coast of the duchy of Lucca. In
the latter case, they were confined principally to prevention
of the intermixing of fresh water with that of the sea. In
1741, sluices or lock gates were constructed for this purpose,
and the following year, the fevers, which had been destructive
to the coast population for a long time previous, disappeared
altogether. In 1768 and 1769, the works having fallen to
decay, the fevers returned in a very malignant form, but the
rebuilding of the gates again restored the healthfulness of the
shore. Similar facts recurred in 1784 and 1785, and again
from 1804 to 1821. This long and repeated experience has at
last impressed upon the people the necessity of vigilant attention
to the sluices, which are now kept in constant repair.
The health of the coast is uninterrupted, and Viareggio, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
capital town of the district, is now much frequented for its sea
baths and its general salubrity, at a season when formerly it
was justly shunned as the abode of disease and death.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>It is now a hundred years since the commencement of the
improvements in the Val di Chiana, and those of the Maremma
have been in more or less continued operation for
above a generation. They have, as we have seen, produced
important geographical changes in the surface of the earth
and in the flow of considerable rivers, and their effects have
been not less conspicuous in preventing other changes, of a
deleterious character, which would infallibly have taken place
if they had not been arrested by the improvements in question.
It has been already stated that, in order to prevent the
overflow of the valley of the Tiber by freely draining the Val
di Chiana into it, the Papal authorities, long before the commencement
of the Tuscan works, constructed strong barriers
near the southern end of the valley, which detained the waters
of the wet season until they could be gradually drawn off into
the Paglia. They consequently deposited most of their sediment
in the Val di Chiana and carried down comparatively
little earth to the Tiber. The lateral streams contributing the
largest quantities of sedimentary matter to the Val di Chiana
originally flowed into that valley near its northern end; and
the change of their channels and outlets in a southern direction,
so as to raise that part of the valley by their deposits and
thereby reverse its drainage, was one of the principal steps in
the process of improvement.</p>

<p>We have seen that the north end of the Val di Chiana
near the Arno had been raised by spontaneous deposit of
sediment to such a height as to interpose a sufficient obstacle
to all flow in that direction. If, then, the Roman
dam had not been erected, or the works of the Tuscan
Government undertaken, the whole of the earth, which has
been arrested by those works and employed to raise the bed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
and reverse the declivity of the valley, would have been carried
down to the Tiber and thence into the sea. The deposit
thus created, would, of course, have contributed to increase
the advance of the shore at the mouth of that river, which has
long been going on at the rate of three m&egrave;tres and nine tenths
(twelve feet and nine inches) per annum.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> It is evident that
a quantity of earth, sufficient to effect the immense changes I
have described in a wide valley more than thirty miles long,
if deposited at the outlet of the Tiber, would have very considerably
modified the outline of the coast, and have exerted no
unimportant influence on the flow of that river, by raising its
point of discharge and lengthening its channel.</p>

<p>The sediment washed into the marshes of the Maremme is
not less than 12,000,000 cubic yards per annum. The escape
of this quantity into the sea, which is now almost wholly prevented,
would be sufficient to advance the coast line fourteen
yards per year, for a distance of forty miles, computing the
mean depth of the sea near the shore at twelve yards. It is
true that in this case, as well as in that of other rivers, the
sedimentary matter would not be distributed equally along
the shore, and much of it would be carried out into deep
water, or perhaps transported by the currents to distant coasts.
The immediate effects of the deposit, therefore, would not be
so palpable as they appear in this numerical form, but they
would be equally certain, and would infallibly manifest themselves,
first, perhaps, at some remote point, and afterward at
or near the outlets of the rivers which produced them.</p>


<h4><i>Obstruction of River Mouths.</i></h4>

<p>The mouths of a large proportion of the streams known to
ancient internal navigation are already blocked up by sandbars
or fluviatile deposits, and the maritime approaches to
river harbors frequented by the ships of Phenicia and Carthage
and Greece and Rome are shoaled to a considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
distance out to sea. The inclination of almost every known
river bed has been considerably reduced within the historical
period, and nothing but great volume of water, or exceptional
rapidity of flow, now enables a few large streams like the
Amazon, the La Plata, the Ganges, and, in a less degree, the
Mississippi, to carry their own deposits far enough out into
deep water to prevent the formation of serious obstructions to
navigation. But the degradation of their banks, and the
transportation of earthy matter to the sea by their currents,
are gradually filling up the estuaries even of these mighty
floods, and unless the threatened evil shall be averted by the
action of geological forces, or by artificial contrivances more
efficient than dredging machines, the destruction of every harbor
in the world which receives a considerable river must
inevitably take place at no very distant date.</p>

<p>This result would, perhaps, have followed in some incalculably
distant future, if man had not come to inhabit the
earth as soon as the natural forces which had formed its surface
had arrived at such an approximate equilibrium that his
existence on the globe was possible; but the general effect of
his industrial operations has been to accelerate it immensely.
Rivers, in countries planted by nature with forests and never
inhabited by man, employ the little earth and gravel they
transport chiefly to raise their own beds and to form plains in
their basins.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> In their upper course, where the current is
swiftest, they are most heavily charged with coarse rolled or
suspended matter, and this, in floods, they deposit on their
shores in the mountain valleys where they rise; in their middle
course, a lighter earth is spread over the bottom of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
widening basins, and forms plains of moderate extent; the fine
silt which floats farther is deposited over a still broader area,
or, if carried out to sea, is, in great part quickly swept far off
by marine currents and dropped at last in deep water. Man's
"improvement" of the soil increases the erosion from its surface;
his arrangements for confining the lateral spread of the
water in floods compel the rivers to transport to their mouths
the earth derived from that erosion even in their upper course;
and, consequently, the sediment they deposit at their outlets is
not only much larger in quantity, but composed of heavier
materials, which sink more readily to the bottom of the sea
and are less easily removed by marine currents.</p>

<p>The tidal movement of the ocean, deep sea currents, and
the agitation of inland waters by the wind, lift up the sands
strewn over the bottom by diluvial streams or sent down by
mountain torrents, and throw them up on dry land, or deposit
them in sheltered bays and nooks of the coast&mdash;for the flowing
is stronger than the ebbing tide, the affluent than the refluent
wave. This cause of injury to harbors it is not in man's
power to resist by any means at present available; but, as we
have seen, something can be done to prevent the degradation
of high grounds, and to diminish the quantity of earth which
is annually abstracted from the mountains, from table lands,
and from river banks, to raise the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>This latter cause of harbor obstruction, though an active
agent, is, nevertheless, in many cases, the less powerful of the
two. The earth suspended in the lower course of fluviatile
currents is lighter than sea sand, river water lighter than sea
water, and hence, if a land stream enters the sea with a considerable
volume, its water flows over that of the sea, and
bears its slime with it until it lets it fall far from shore, or, as
is more frequently the case, mingles with some marine current
and transports its sediment to a remote point of deposit. The
earth borne out of the mouths of the Nile is in part carried
over the waves which throw up sea sand on the beach, and
deposited in deep water, in part drifted by the current, which
sweeps east and north along the coasts of Egypt and Syria,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
until it finds a resting place in the northeastern angle of the
Mediterranean.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Thus the earth loosened by the rude Abyssinian
ploughshare, and washed down by the rain from the
hills of Ethiopia which man has stripped of their protecting
forests, contributes to raise the plains of Egypt, to shoal the
maritime channels which lead to the city built by Alexander
near the mouth of the Nile, and to fill up the harbors made
famous by Phenician commerce.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Subterranean Waters.</i></h4>

<p>I have frequently alluded to a branch of geography, the
importance of which is but recently adequately recognized&mdash;the
subterranean waters of the earth considered as stationary
reservoirs, as flowing currents, and as filtrating fluids. The
earth drinks in moisture by direct absorption from the atmosphere,
by the deposition of dew, by rain and snow, by percolation
from rivers and other superficial bodies of water, and
sometimes by currents flowing into caves or smaller visible
apertures.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> Some of this humidity is exhaled again by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
soil, some is taken up by organic growths and by inorganic
compounds, some poured out upon the surface by springs and
either immediately evaporated or carried down to larger
streams and to the sea, some flows by subterranean courses
into the bed of fresh-water rivers<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> or of the ocean, and some
remains, though even here not in forever motionless repose, to
fill deep cavities and underground channels.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> In every case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
the aqueous vapors of the air are the ultimate source of supply,
and all these hidden stores are again returned to the atmosphere
by evaporation.</p>

<p>The proportion of the water of precipitation taken up by
direct evaporation from the surface of the ground seems to
have been generally exaggerated, sufficient allowance not
being made for moisture carried downward, or in a lateral
direction, by infiltration or by crevices in the superior rocky
or earthy strata. According to Wittwer, Mariotte found that
but one sixth of the precipitation in the basin of the Seine was
delivered into the sea by that river, "so that five sixths
remained for evaporation and consumption by the organic
world."<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>Lieutenant Maury&mdash;whose scientific reputation, though
fallen, has not quite sunk to the level of his patriotism&mdash;estimates
the annual amount of precipitation in the valley of the
Mississippi at 620 cubic miles, the discharge of that river into
the sea at 107 cubic miles, and concludes that "this would
leave 513 cubic miles of water to be evaporated from this
river basin annually."<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> In these and other like computations,
the water carried down into the earth by capillary and larger
conduits is wholly lost sight of, and no thought is bestowed
upon the supply for springs, for common and artesian wells,
and for underground rivers, like those in the great caves of
Kentucky, which may gush up in fresh-water currents at the
bottom of the Caribbean Sea, or rise to the light of day in the
far-off peninsula of Florida.</p>

<p>The progress of the emphatically modern science of geology
has corrected these erroneous views, because the observations
on which it depends have demonstrated not only the existence,
but the movement, of water in nearly all geological formations,
have collected evidence of the presence of large reservoirs
at greater or less depths beneath surfaces of almost every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
character, and have investigated the rationale of the attendant
phenomena. The distribution of these waters has been minutely
studied with reference to a great number of localities,
and though the actual mode of their vertical and horizontal
transmission is still involved in much doubt, the laws which
determine their aggregation are so well understood, that, when
the geology of a given district is known, it is not difficult to
determine at what depth water will be reached by the borer,
and to what height it will rise.</p>

<p>The same principles have been successfully applied to the
discovery of small subterranean collections or currents of water,
and some persons have acquired, by a moderate knowledge of
the superficial structure of the earth combined with long practice,
a skill in the selection of favorable places for digging
wells which seems to common observers little less than miraculous.
The Abb&eacute; Paramelle&mdash;a French ecclesiastic who devoted
himself for some years to this subject and was extensively
employed as a well-finder&mdash;states, in his work on Fountains,
that in the course of thirty-four years he had pointed out more
than ten thousand subterranean springs, and though his geological
speculations were often erroneous, the highest scientific
authorities in Europe have testified to the great practical value
of his methods, and the almost infallible certainty of his predictions.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>Babinet quotes a French proverb, "Summer rain wets
nothing," and explains it as meaning that the water of such
rains is "almost totally taken up by evaporation." "The
rains of summer," he adds, "however abundant they may be,
do not penetrate the soil to a greater depth than 15 or 20
centim&egrave;tres. In summer the evaporating power of the heat is
five or six times as great as in winter, and this power is
exerted by an atmosphere capable of containing five times as
much vapor as in winter." "A stratum of snow which prevents
evaporation [from the soil] causes almost all the water
that composes it to filter down into the earth, and form a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
reserve for springs, wells, and rivers which could not be supplied
by any amount of summer rain." "This latter&mdash;useful,
indeed like dew, to vegetation&mdash;does not penetrate the soil
and accumulate a store to feed springs and to be brought up
by them to the open air."<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> This conclusion, however applicable
it may be to the climate and soil of France, is too broadly
stated to be accepted as a general truth, and in countries
where the precipitation is small in the winter months, familiar
observation shows that the quantity of water yielded by deep
wells and natural springs depends not less on the rains of summer
than on those of the rest of the year, and, consequently,
that much of the precipitation of that season must find its way
to strata too deep to lose water by evaporation.</p>

<p>The supply of subterranean reservoirs and currents, as well
as of springs, is undoubtedly derived chiefly from infiltration,
and hence it must be affected by all changes of the natural
surface that accelerate or retard the drainage of the soil, or
that either promote or obstruct evaporation from it. It has
sufficiently appeared from what has gone before, that the spontaneous
drainage of cleared ground is more rapid than that of
the forest, and consequently, that the felling of the woods, as
well as the draining of swamps, deprives the subterranean
waters of accessions which would otherwise be conveyed to
them by infiltration. The same effect is produced by artificial
contrivances for drying the soil either by open ditches or by
underground pipes or channels, and in proportion as the sphere
of these operations is extended, the effect of them cannot fail
to make itself more and more sensibly felt in the diminished
supply of water furnished by wells and running springs.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span></p>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that loose soils, stripped of vegetation
and broken up by the plough or other processes of cultivation,
may, until again carpeted by grasses or other plants,
absorb more rain and snow water than when they were covered
by a natural growth; but it is also true that the evaporation
from such soils is augmented in a still greater proportion.
Rain scarcely penetrates beneath the sod of grass ground, but
runs off over the surface; and after the heaviest showers a
ploughed field will often be dried by evaporation before the
water can be carried off by infiltration, while the soil of a
neighboring grove will remain half saturated for weeks together.
Sandy soils frequently rest on a tenacious subsoil, at
a moderate depth, as is usually seen in the pine plains of the
United States, where pools of rain water collect in slight depressions
on the surface of earth, the upper stratum of which
is as porous as a sponge. In the open grounds such pools are
very soon dried up by the sun and wind; in the woods they
remain unevaporated long enough for the water to diffuse itself
laterally until it finds, in the subsoil, crevices through which
it may escape, or slopes which it may follow to their outcrop
or descend along them to lower strata.</p>

<p>The readiness with which water not obstructed by impermeable
strata diffuses itself through the earth in all directions&mdash;and,
consequently, the importance of keeping up the supply
of subterranean reservoirs&mdash;find a familiar illustration in the
effect of paving the ground about the stems of vines and trees.
The surface earth around the trunk of a tree may be made perfectly
impervious to water, by flag stones and cement, for a
distance greater than the spread of the roots; and yet the tree
will not suffer for want of moisture, except in droughts severe
enough sensibly to affect the supply in deep wells and springs.
Both forest and fruit trees grow well in cities where the streets
and courts are closely paved, and where even the lateral access
of water to the roots is more or less obstructed by deep cellars
and foundation walls. The deep-lying veins and sheets of
water, supplied by infiltration from above, send up moisture
by capillary attraction, and the pavement prevents the soil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
beneath it from losing its humidity by evaporation. Hence,
city-grown trees find moisture enough for their roots, and
though plagued with smoke and dust, often retain their freshness
while those planted in the open fields, where sun and
wind dry up the soil faster than the subterranean fountains
can water it, are withering from drought. Without the help
of artificial conduit or of water carrier, the Thames and the
Seine refresh the ornamental trees that shade the thoroughfares
of London and of Paris, and beneath the hot and reeking
mould of Egypt, the Nile sends currents to the extremest border
of its valley.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<h4><i>Artesian Wells.</i></h4>

<p>The existence of artesian wells depends upon that of subterranean
reservoirs and rivers, and the supply yielded by
borings is regulated by the abundance of such sources. The
waters of the earth are, in many cases, derived from superficial
currents which are seen to pour into chasms opened, as it were,
expressly for their reception; and in others where no apertures
in the crust of the earth have been detected, their existence is
proved by the fact that artesian wells sometimes bring up
from great depths seeds, leaves, and even living fish, which
must have been carried down through channels large enough
to admit a considerable stream. But in general, the sheets
and currents of water reached by deep boring appear to be
primarily due to infiltration from highlands where the water is
first collected in superficial or subterranean reservoirs. By
means of channels conforming to the dip of the strata, these
reservoirs communicate with the lower basins, and exert upon
them a fluid pressure sufficient to raise a column to the surface,
whenever an orifice is opened.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> The water delivered by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
an artesian well is, therefore, often derived from distant
sources, and may be wholly unaffected by geographical or
meteorological changes in its immediate neighborhood, while
the same changes may quite dry up common wells and springs
which are fed only by the local infiltration of their own narrow
basins.</p>

<p>In most cases, artesian wells have been bored for purely
economical or industrial purposes, such as to obtain good water
for domestic use or for driving light machinery, to reach saline
or other mineral springs, and recently, in America, to open
fountains of petroleum or rock oil. The geographical and geological
effects of such abstraction of fluids from the bowels of
the earth are too remote and uncertain to be here noticed;<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>
but artesian wells have lately been employed in Algeria for a
purpose which has even now a substantial, and may hereafter
acquire a very great geographical importance. It was observed
by many earlier as well as recent travellers in the East,
among whom Shaw deserves special mention, that the Libyan
desert, bordering upon the cultivated shores of the Mediterranean,
appeared in many places to rest upon a subterranean
lake at an accessible distance below the surface. The Moors
are vaguely said to have <i>bored</i> artesian wells down to this
reservoir, to obtain water for domestic use and irrigation, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
I do not find such wells described by any trustworthy traveller,
and the universal astonishment and incredulity with
which the native tribes viewed the operations of the French
engineers sent into the desert for that purpose, are a sufficient
proof that this mode of reaching the subterranean waters was
new to them. They were, however, aware of the existence of
water below the sands, and were dexterous in digging wells&mdash;square
shafts lined with a framework of palm-tree stems&mdash;to
the level of the sheet. The wells so constructed, though not
technically artesian wells, answer the same purpose; for the
water rises to the surface and flows over it as from a spring.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span></p>

<p>These wells, however, are too few and too scanty in supply
to serve any other purposes than the domestic wells of other
countries, and it is but recently that the transformation of
desert into cultivable land by this means has been seriously
attempted. The French Government has bored a large number
of artesian wells in the Algerian desert within a few years,
and the native sheikhs are beginning to avail themselves of
the process. Every well becomes the nucleus of a settlement
proportioned to the supply of water, and before the end of the
year 1860, several nomade tribes had abandoned their wandering
life, established themselves around the wells, and
planted more than 30,000 palm trees, besides other perennial
vegetables.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> The water is found at a small depth, generally
from 100 to 200 feet, and though containing too large a pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>portion
of mineral matter to be acceptable to a European palate,
it answers well for irrigation, and does not prove unwholesome
to the natives.</p>

<p>The most obvious use of artesian wells in the desert at
present is that of creating stations for the establishment of military
posts and halting places for the desert traveller; but if
the supply of water shall prove adequate for the indefinite
extension of the system, it is probably destined to produce a
greater geographical transformation than has ever been effected
by any scheme of human improvement. The most striking
contrast of landscape scenery that nature brings near together
in time or place, is that between the greenery of the tropics,
or of a northern summer, and the snowy pall of leafless winter.
Next to this in startling novelty of effect, we must rank the
sudden transition from the shady and verdant oasis of the
desert to the bare and burning party-colored ocean of sand and
rock which surrounds it.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> The most sanguine believer in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
indefinite human progress hardly expects that man's cunning
will accomplish the universal fufilment of the prophecy, "the
desert shall blossom as the rose," in its literal sense; but sober
geographers have thought the future conversion of the sand
plains of Northern Africa into fruitful gardens, by means of
artesian wells, not an improbable expectation. They have
gone farther, and argued that, if the soil were covered with
fields and forests, vegetation would call down moisture from
the Libyan sky, and that the showers which are now wasted
on the sea, or so often deluge Southern Europe with destructive
inundation, would in part be condensed over the arid
wastes of Africa, and thus, without further aid from man,
bestow abundance on regions which nature seems to have condemned
to perpetual desolation.</p>

<p>An equally bold speculation, founded on the well-known
fact, that the temperature of the earth and of its internal waters
increases as we descend beneath the surface, has suggested that
artesian wells might supply heat for industrial and domestic
purposes, for hot-house cultivation, and even for the local
amelioration of climate. The success with which Count Lardarello
has employed natural hot springs for the evaporation
of water charged with boracic acid, and other fortunate applications
of the heat of thermal sources, lend some countenance
to the latter project; but both must, for the present, be ranked
among the vague possibilities of science, not regarded as probable
future triumphs of man over nature.</p>


<h4><i>Artificial Springs.</i></h4>

<p>A more plausible and inviting scheme is that of the creation
of perennial springs by husbanding rain and snow water,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
storing it up in artificial reservoirs of earth, and filtering it
through purifying strata, in analogy with the operations of
nature. The sagacious Palissy&mdash;starting from the theory that
all springs are primarily derived from precipitation, and reasoning
justly on the accumulation and movement of water in
the earth&mdash;proposed to reduce theory to practice, and to imitate
the natural processes by which rain is absorbed by the
earth and given out again in running fountains. "When I
had long and diligently considered the cause of the springing
of natural fountains and the places where they be wont to
issue," says he, "I did plainly perceive, at last, that they do
proceed and are engendered of nought but the rains. And it
is this, look you, which hath moved me to enterprise the gathering
together of rain water after the manner of nature, and
the most closely according to her fashion that I am able; and
I am well assured that by following the formulary of the
Supreme Contriver of fountains, I can make springs, the water
whereof shall be as good and pure and clear as of such which
be natural."<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> Palissy discusses the subject of the origin
of springs at length and with much ability, dwelling specially
on infiltration, and, among other things, thus explains the frequency
of springs in mountainous regions: "Having well
considered the which, thou mayest plainly see the reason why
there be more springs and rivulets proceeding from the mountains
than from the rest of the earth; which is for no other
cause but that the rocks and mountains do retain the water of
the rains like vessels of brass. And the said waters falling
upon the said mountains descend continually through the earth,
and through crevices, and stop not till they find some place
that is bottomed with stone or close and thick rocks; and they
rest upon such bottom until they find some channel or other
manner of issue, and then they flow out in springs or brooks
or rivers, according to the greatness of the reservoirs and of
the outlets thereof."<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>After a full exposition of his theory, Palissy proceeds to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
describe his method of creating springs, which is substantially
the same as that lately proposed by Babinet in the following
terms: "Choose a piece of ground containing four or five
acres, with a sandy soil, and with a gentle slope to determine
the flow of the water. Along its upper line, dig a trench five
or six feet deep and six feet wide. Level the bottom of the
trench, and make it impermeable by paving, by macadamizing,
by bitumen, or, more simply and cheaply, by a layer of clay.
By the side of this trench dig another, and throw the earth
from it into the first, and so on until you have rendered the
subsoil of the whole parcel impermeable to rain water. Build
a wall along the lower line with an aperture in the middle for
the water, and plant fruit or other low trees upon the whole,
to shade the ground and check the currents of air which promote
evaporation. This will infallibly give you a good spring
which will flow without intermission and supply the wants of
a whole hamlet or a large chateau."<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> Babinet states that the
whole amount of precipitation on a reservoir of the proposed
area, in the climate of Paris, would be about 13,000 cubic
yards, not above one half of which, he thinks, would be lost,
and, of course, the other half would remain available to supply
the spring. I much doubt whether this expectation would be
realized in practice, in its whole extent; for if Babinet is right
in supposing that the summer rain is wholly evaporated, the
winter rains, being much less in quantity, would hardly suffice
to keep the earth saturated and give off so large a surplus.</p>

<p>The method of Palissy, though, as I have said, similar in
principle to that of Babinet, would be cheaper of execution,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
and, at the same time, more efficient. He proposes the construction
of relatively small filtering receptacles, into which he
would conduct the rain falling upon a large area of rocky
hillside, or other sloping ground not readily absorbing water.
This process would, in all probability, be a very successful, as
well as an inexpensive, mode of economizing atmospheric precipitation,
and compelling the rain and snow to form perennial
fountains at will.</p>


<h4><i>Economizing Precipitation.</i></h4>

<p>The methods suggested by Palissy and by Babinet are of
limited application, and designed only to supply a sufficient
quantity of water for the domestic use of small villages or large
private establishments. Dumas has proposed a much more
extensive system for collecting and retaining the whole precipitation
in considerable valleys, and storing it in reservoirs,
whence it is to be drawn for household and mechanical purposes,
for irrigation, and, in short, for all the uses to which the
water of natural springs and brooks is applicable. His plan
consists in draining both surface and subsoil, by means of conduits
differing in construction according to local circumstances,
but in the main not unlike those employed in improved agriculture,
collecting the water in a central channel, securing its
proper filterage, checking its too rapid flow by barriers at convenient
points, and finally receiving the whole in spacious
covered reservoirs, from which it may be discharged in a constant
flow or at intervals as convenience may dictate.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>There is no reasonable doubt that a very wide employment
of these various contrivances for economizing and supplying
water is practicable, and the expediency of resorting to them
is almost purely an economical question. There appears to be
no serious reason to apprehend collateral evils from them, and
in fact all of them, except artesian wells, are simply indirect
methods of returning to the original arrangements of nature,
or, in other words, of restoring the fluid circulation of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
globe; for when the earth was covered with the forest, perennial
springs gushed from the foot of every hill, brooks flowed
down the bed of every valley. The partial recovery of the
fountains and rivulets which once abundantly watered the face
of the agricultural world seems practicable by such means,
even without any general replanting of the forests; and the
cost of one year's warfare, if judiciously expended in a combination
of both methods of improvement, would secure, to
almost every country that man has exhausted, an amelioration
of climate, a renovated fertility of soil, and a general physical
improvement, which might almost be characterized as a new
creation.</p>

<h4><i>Origin of Sand.</i></h4>

<p>Sand, which is found in beds or strata at the bottom of the
sea or in the channels of rivers, as well as in extensive deposits
upon or beneath the surface of the dry land, appears to
consist essentially of the detritus of rocks. It is not always by
any means clear through what agency the solid rock has been
reduced to a granular condition; for there are beds of quartzose
sand, where the sharp, angular shape of the particles renders
it highly improbable that they have been formed by
gradual abrasion and attrition, and where the supposition of a
crushing mechanical force seems equally inadmissible. In
common sand, the quartz grains are the most numerous; but
this is not a proof that the rocks from which these particles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
were derived were wholly, or even chiefly, quartzose in character;
for, in many composite rocks, as, for example, in the
granitic group, the mica, felspar, and hornblende are more
easily decomposed by chemical action, or disintegrated, comminuted,
and reduced to an impalpable state by mechanical
force, than the quartz. In the destruction of such rocks, therefore,
the quartz would survive the other ingredients, and
remain unmixed, when they had been decomposed and had
entered into new chemical combinations, or been ground to
slime and washed away by water currents.</p>

<p>The greater or less specific gravity of the different constituents
of rock doubtless aids in separating them into distinct
masses when once disintegrated, though there are veined and
stratified beds of sand where the difference between the upper
and lower layers, in this respect, is too slight to be supposed
capable of effecting a complete separation.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> In cases where
rock has been reduced to sandy fragments by heat, or by
obscure chemical and other molecular forces, the sandbeds
may remain undisturbed, and represent, in the series of geological
strata, the solid formations from which they were
derived. The large masses of sand not found in place have
been transported and accumulated by water or by wind, the
former being generally considered the most important of these
agencies; for the extensive deposits of the Sahara, of the deserts
of Persia, and of that of Gobi, are commonly supposed to
have been swept together or distributed by marine currents,
and to have been elevated above the ocean by the same means
as other upheaved strata.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span></p>

<p>Meteoric and mechanical influences are still active in the
reduction of rocks to a fragmentary state; but the quantity of
sand now transported to the sea seems to be comparatively
inconsiderable, because&mdash;not to speak of the absence of diluvial
action&mdash;the number of torrents emptying directly into the sea
is much less than it was at earlier periods. The formation of
alluvial plains in maritime bays, by the sedimentary matter
brought down from the mountains, has lengthened the flow of
such streams and converted them very generally into rivers,
or rather affluents of rivers much younger than themselves.
The filling up of the estuaries has so reduced the slope of all
large and many small rivers, and, consequently, so checked the
current of what the Germans call their <i>Unterlauf</i>, or lower
course, that they are much less able to transport heavy material
than at earlier epochs. The slime deposited by rivers at
their junction with the sea, is usually found to be composed
of material too finely ground and too light to be denominated
sand, and it can be abundantly shown that the sandbanks at
the outlet of large streams are of tidal, not of fluviatile origin,
or, in lakes and tideless seas, a result of the concurrent action
of waves and of wind.</p>

<p>Large deposits of sand, therefore, must in general be considered
as of ancient, not of recent formation, and many eminent
geologists ascribe them to diluvial action. Staring has
discussed this question very fully, with special reference to the
sands of the North Sea, the Zuiderzee, and the bays and channels
of the Dutch coast.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> His general conclusion is, that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
rivers of the Netherlands "move sand only by a very slow displacement
of sandbanks, and do not carry it with them as a
suspended or floating material." The sands of the German
Ocean he holds to be a product of the "great North German
drift," deposited where they now lie before the commencement
of the present geological period, and he maintains similar
opinions with regard to the sands thrown up by the Mediterranean
at the mouths of the Nile and on the Barbary coast.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>


<h4><i>Sand now carried to the Sea.</i></h4>

<p>There are, however, cases where mountain streams still
bear to the sea perhaps relatively small, but certainly absolutely
large, amounts of disintegrated rock.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> The quantity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
sand and gravel carried into the Mediterranean by the torrents
of the Maritime Alps, the Ligurian Apennines, the islands of
Corsica, Sardinia, and Sicily, and the mountains of Calabria, is
apparently great. In mere mass, it is possible, if not probable,
that as much rocky material, more or less comminuted, is contributed
to the basin of the Mediterranean by Europe, even
excluding the shores of the Adriatic and the Euxine, as is
washed up from it upon the coasts of Africa and Syria. A
great part of this material is thrown out again by the waves
on the European shores of that sea. The harbors of Luni, Albenga,
San Remo, and Savona west of Genoa, and of Porto
Fino on the other side, are filling up, and the coast near Carrara
and Massa is said to have advanced upon the sea to a dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>tance
of 475 feet in thirty-three years.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Besides this, we have no
evidence of the existence of deep-water currents in the Mediterranean,
extensive enough and strong enough to transport
quartzose sand across the sea. It may be added that much of
the rock from which the torrent sands of Southern Europe are
derived contains little quartz, and hence the general character
of these sands is such that they must be decomposed or ground
down to an impalpable slime, long before they could be swept
over to the African shore.</p>

<p>The torrents of Europe, then, do not at present furnish the
material which composes the beach sands of Northern Africa,
and it is equally certain that those sands are not brought down
by the rivers of the latter continent. They belong to a remote
geological period, and have been accumulated by causes which
we cannot at present assign. The wind does not stir water to
great depths with sufficient force to disturb the bottom,<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
the sand thrown upon the coast in question must be derived
from a narrow belt of sea. It must hence, in time, become
exhausted, and the formation of new sandbanks and dunes
upon the southern shores of the Mediterranean will cease at
last for want of material.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>But even in the cases where the accumulations of sand in
extensive deserts appear to be of marine formation, or rather
aggregation, and to have been brought to their present position
by upheaval, they are not wholly composed of material
collected or distributed by the currents of the sea; for, in all
such regions, they continue to receive some small contributions
from the disintegration of the rocks which underlie, or crop
out through, the superficial deposits. In some instances, too,
as in Northern Africa, additions are constantly made to the
mass by the prevalence of sea winds, which transport, or, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
speak more precisely, roll the finer beach sand to considerable
distances into the interior. But this is a very slow process, and
the exaggerations of travellers have diffused a vast deal of
popular error on the subject.</p>


<h4><i>Sands of Egypt.</i></h4>

<p>In the narrow valley of the Nile&mdash;which, above its bifurcation
near Cairo, is, throughout Egypt and Nubia, generally
bounded by precipitous cliffs&mdash;wherever a ravine or other considerable
depression occurs in the wall of rock, one sees what
seems a stream of desert sand pouring down, and common
observers have hence concluded that the whole valley is in
danger of being buried under a stratum of infertile soil. The
ancient Egyptians apprehended this, and erected walls, often
of unburnt brick, across the outlet of gorges and lateral valleys,
to check the flow of the sand streams. In later ages,
these walls have mostly fallen into decay, and no preventive
measures against such encroachments are now resorted to. But
the extent of the mischief to the soil of Egypt, and the future
danger from this source, have been much overrated. The sand
on the borders of the Nile is neither elevated so high by the
wind, nor transported by that agency in so great masses, as is
popularly supposed; and of that which is actually lifted or
rolled and finally deposited by air currents, a considerable
proportion is either calcareous, and, therefore, readily decomposable,
or in the state of a very fine dust, and so, in neither
case, injurious to the soil. There are, indeed, both in Africa and
in Arabia, considerable tracts of fine silicious sand, which may
be carried far by high winds, but these are exceptional cases,
and in general the progress of the desert sand is by a rolling
motion along the surface.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> So little is it lifted, and so incon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>siderable
is the quantity yet remaining on the borders of
Egypt, that a wall four or five feet high suffices for centuries
to check its encroachments. This is obvious to the eye of
every observer who prefers the true to the marvellous; but
the old-world fable of the overwhelming of caravans by the
fearful simoom&mdash;which, even the Arabs no longer repeat, if
indeed they are the authors of it&mdash;is so thoroughly rooted in
the imagination of Christendom that most desert travellers, of
the tourist class, think they shall disappoint the readers of
their journals if they do not recount the particulars of their
escape from being buried alive by a sand storm, and the popular
demand for a "sensation" must be gratified accordingly.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span></p>

<p>Another circumstance is necessary to be considered in estimating
the danger to which the arable lands of Egypt are
exposed. The prevailing wind in the valley of the Nile and
its borders is from the north, and it may be said without
exaggeration that the north wind blows for three quarters of
the year.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> The effect of winds blowing up the valley is to
drive the sands of the desert plateau which border it, in a
direction parallel with the axis of the valley, not transversely
to it; and if it ran in a straight line, the north wind would
carry no desert sand into it. There are, however, both curves
and angles in its course, and hence, wherever its direction
deviates from that of the wind, it might receive sand drifts
from the desert plain through which it runs. But, in the
course of ages, the winds have, in a great measure, bared the
projecting points of their ancient deposits, and no great accumulations
remain in situations from which either a north or a
south wind would carry them into the valley.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>


<h4><i>The Suez Canal.</i></h4>

<p>These considerations apply, with equal force, to the supposed
danger of the obstruction of the Suez Canal by the drift<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>ing
of the desert sands. The winds across the isthmus are
almost uniformly from the north, and they swept it clean of
flying sands long ages since. The traces of the ancient canal
between the Red Sea and the Nile are easily followed for a
considerable distance from Suez. Had the drifts upon the
isthmus been as formidable as some have feared and others
have hoped, those traces would have been obliterated, and
Lake Timsah and the Bitter Lakes filled up, many centuries
ago. The few particles driven by the rare east and west
winds toward the line of the canal, would easily be arrested
by plantations or other simple methods, or removed by dredging.
The real dangers and difficulties of this magnificent
enterprise&mdash;and they are great&mdash;consist in the nature of the
soil to be removed in order to form the line, and especially in
the constantly increasing accumulation of sea sand at the southern
terminus by the tides of the Red Sea, and at the northern,
by the action of the winds. Both seas are shallow for miles
from the shore, and the excavation and maintenance of deep
channels, and of capacious harbors with easy and secure entrances,
in such localities, is doubtless one of the hardest problems
offered to modern engineers for practical solution.</p>


<h4><i>Sands of Egypt.</i></h4>

<p>The sand let fall in Egypt by the north wind is derived,
not from the desert, but from a very different source&mdash;the sea.
Considerable quantities of sand are thrown up by the Mediterranean,
at and between the mouths of the Nile, and indeed
along almost the whole southern coast of that sea, and drifted
into the interior to distances varying according to the force of
the wind and the abundance and quality of the material. The
sand so transported contributes to the gradual elevation of the
Delta, and of the banks and bed of the river itself. But just
in proportion as the bed of the stream is elevated, the height
of the water in the annual inundations is increased also, and as
the inclination of the channel is diminished, the rapidity of the
current is checked, and the deposition of the slime it holds in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
suspension consequently promoted. Thus the winds and the
water, moving in contrary directions, join in producing a common
effect.</p>

<p>The sand, blown over the Delta and the cultivated land
higher up the stream during the inundation, is covered or
mixed with the fertile earth brought down by the river, and
no serious injury is sustained from it. That spread over the
same ground after the water has subsided, and during the
short period when the soil is not stirred by cultivation or covered
by the flood, forms a thin pellicle over the surface as far
as it extends, and serves to divide and distinguish the successive
layers of slime deposited by the annual inundations. The
particles taken up by the wind on the sea beach are borne
onward, by a hopping motion, or rolled along the surface,
until they are arrested by the temporary cessation of the wind,
by vegetation, or by some other obstruction, and they may, in
process of time, accumulate in large masses, under the lee of
rocky projections, buildings, or other barriers which break the
force of the wind.</p>

<p>In these facts we find the true explanation of the sand
drifts, which have half buried the Sphinx and so many other
ancient monuments in that part of Egypt. These drifts, as I
have said, are not primarily from the desert, but from the sea;
and, as might be supposed from the distance they have travelled,
they have been long in gathering. While Egypt was a
great and flourishing kingdom, measures were taken to protect
its territory against the encroachment of sand, whether from
the desert or from the sea; but the foreign conquerors, who
destroyed so many of its religious monuments, did not spare
its public works, and the process of physical degradation undoubtedly
began as early as the Persian invasion. The urgent
necessity, which has compelled all the successive tyrannies of
Egypt to keep up some of the canals and other arrangements
for irrigation, was not felt with respect to the advancement of
the sands; for their progress was so slow as hardly to be perceptible
in the course of a single reign, and long experience
has shown that, from the natural effect of the inundations, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
cultivable soil of the valley is, on the whole, trenching upon
the domain of the desert, not retreating before it.</p>

<p>The oases of the Libyan, as well as of many Asiatic deserts,
have no such safeguards. The sands are fast encroaching upon
them, and threaten soon to engulf them, unless man shall resort
to artesian wells and plantations, or to some other efficient
means of checking the advance of this formidable enemy, in
time to save these islands of the waste from final destruction.</p>

<p>Accumulations of sand are, in certain cases, beneficial as a
protection against the ravages of the sea; but, in general, the
vicinity, and especially the shifting of bodies of this material,
are destructive to human industry, and hence, in civilized
countries, measures are taken to prevent its spread. This,
however, can be done only where the population is large and
enlightened, and the value of the soil, or of the artificial erections
and improvements upon it, is considerable. Hence in
the deserts of Africa and of Asia, and the inhabited lands
which border on them, no pains are usually taken to check the
drifts, and when once the fields, the houses, the springs, or the
canals of irrigation are covered or choked, the district is abandoned
without a struggle, and surrendered to perpetual desolation.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>


<h4><i>Sand Dunes and Sand Plains.</i></h4>

<p>Two forms of sand deposit are specially important in European
and American geography. The one is that of dune or
shifting hillock upon the coast, the other that of barren plain
in the interior. The coast dunes are composed of sand washed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
up from the depths of the sea by the waves, and heaped in
knolls and ridges by the winds. The sand with which many
plains are covered, appears sometimes to have been deposited
upon them while they were yet submerged, sometimes to have
been drifted from the sea coast, and scattered over them by
wind currents, sometimes to have been washed upon them by
running water. In these latter cases, the deposit, though in
itself considerable, is comparatively narrow in extent and
irregular in distribution, while, in the former, it is often evenly
spread over a very wide surface. In all great bodies of either
sort, the silicious grains are the principal constituent, though,
when not resulting from the disintegration of silicious rock
and still remaining in place, they are generally accompanied
with a greater or less admixture of other mineral particles, and
of animal and vegetable remains,<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> and they are, also, usually
somewhat changed in consistence by the ever-varying conditions
of temperature and moisture to which they have been
exposed since their deposit. Unless the proportion of these
latter ingredients is so large as to create a certain adhesiveness
in the mass&mdash;in which case it can no longer properly be called
sand&mdash;it is infertile, and, if not charged with water, partially
agglutinated by iron, lime, or other cement, or confined by
alluvion resting upon it, it is much inclined to drift, whenever,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
by any chance, the vegetable network which, in most cases,
thinly clothes and at the same time confines it, is broken.</p>

<p>Human industry has not only fixed the flying dunes, but,
by mixing clay and other tenacious earths with the superficial
stratum of extensive sand plains, and by the application of fertilizing
substances, it has made them abundantly productive
of vegetable life. These latter processes belong to agriculture
and not to geography, and, therefore, are not embraced within
the scope of the present subject. But the preliminary steps,
whereby wastes of loose, drifting barren sands are transformed
into wooded knolls and plains, and finally, through the accumulation
of vegetable mould, into arable ground, constitute a
conquest over nature which precedes agriculture&mdash;a geographical
revolution&mdash;and, therefore, an account of the means by
which the change has been effected belongs properly to the
history of man's influence on the great features of physical
geography. I proceed, then, to examine the structure of
dunes, and to describe the warfare man wages with the sand
hills, striving on the one hand to maintain and even extend
them, as a natural barrier against encroachments of the sea,
and, on the other, to check their moving and wandering propensities,
and prevent them from trespassing upon the fields he
has planted and the habitations in which he dwells.</p>


<h4><i>Coast Dunes.</i></h4>

<p>Coast dunes are oblong ridges or round hillocks, formed by
the action of the wind upon sands thrown up by the waves on
the beach of seas, and sometimes of fresh-water lakes. On
most coasts, the supply of sand for the formation of dunes is
derived from tidal waves. The flow of the tide is more rapid,
and consequently its transporting power greater, than that of
the ebb; the momentum, acquired by the heavy particles in
rolling in with the water, tends to carry them even beyond the
flow of the waves; and at the turn of the tide, the water is in
a state of repose long enough to allow it to let fall much of the
solid matter it holds in suspension. Hence, on all low, tide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>-washed
coasts of seas with sandy bottoms, there exist several
conditions favorable to the formation of sand deposits along
high-water mark.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> If the land winds are of greater fre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>quency,
duration, or strength than the sea winds, the sands
left by the retreating wave will be constantly blown back into
the water; but if the prevailing air currents are in the opposite
direction, the sands will soon be carried out of the reach
of the highest waves, and transported continually farther and
farther into the interior of the land, unless obstructed by high
grounds, vegetation, or other obstacles.</p>

<p>The tide, though a usual, is by no means a necessary condition
for the accumulations of sand out of which dunes are
formed. The Baltic and the Mediterranean are almost tideless
seas, but there are dunes on the Russian and Prussian coasts
of the Baltic, and at the mouths of the Nile and many other
points on the shores of the Mediterranean. The vast shoals in
the latter sea, known to the ancients as the Greater and Lesser
Syrtis, are of marine origin. They are still filling up with
sand, washed up from greater depths, or sometimes drifted
from the coast in small quantities, and will probably be converted,
at some future period, into dry land covered with sand
hills. There are also extensive ranges of dunes upon the eastern
shores of the Caspian, and at the southern, or rather southeastern
extremity of Lake Michigan.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> There is no doubt that
this latter lake formerly extended much farther in that direction,
but its southern portion has gradually shoaled and at last
been converted into solid land, in consequence of the prevalence
of the northwest winds. These blow over the lake a
large part of the year, and create a southwardly set of the currents,
which wash up sand from the bed of the lake and throw
it on shore. Sand is taken up from the beach at Michigan City
by every wind from that quarter, and, after a heavy blow of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
some hours' duration, sand ridges may be observed on the
north side of the fences, like the snow wreaths deposited by a
drifting wind in winter. Some of the particles are carried
back by contrary winds, but most of them lodge on or behind
the dunes, or in the moist soil near the lake, or are entangled
by vegetables, and tend permanently to elevate the level.
Like effects are produced by constant sea winds, and dunes
will generally be formed on all low coasts where such prevail,
whether in tideless or in tidal waters.</p>

<p>Jobard thus describes the <i>modus operandi</i>, under ordinary
circumstances, at the mouths of the Nile, where a tide can
scarcely be detected: "When a wave breaks, it deposits an
almost imperceptible line of fine sand. The next wave brings
also its contribution, and shoves the preceding line a little
higher. As soon as the particles are fairly out of the reach of
the water they are dried by the heat of the burning sun, and
immediately seized by the wind and rolled or borne farther
inland. The gravel is not thrown out by the waves, but rolls
backward and forward until it is worn down to the state of
fine sand, when it, in its turn, is cast upon the land and taken
up by the wind."<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> This description applies only to the common
every-day action of wind and water; but just in proportion
to the increasing force of the wind and the waves, there is
an increase in the quantity of sand, and in the magnitude of
the particles carried off from the beach by it, and, of course,
every storm in a landward direction adds sensibly to the accumulation
upon the shore.</p>


<h4><i>Sand Banks.</i></h4>

<p>Although dunes, properly so called, are found only on dry
land and above ordinary high-water mark, and owe their
elevation and structure to the action of the wind, yet, upon
many shelving coasts, accumulations of sand much resembling
dunes are formed under water at some distance from the shore
by the oscillations of the waves, and are well known by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
name of sand banks. They are usually rather ridges than
banks, of moderate inclination, and with the steepest slope seaward;
and their form differs from that of dunes only in being
lower and more continuous. Upon the western coast of the
island of Amrum, for example, there are three rows of such
banks, the summits of which are at a distance of perhaps a
couple of miles from each other; so that, including the width
of the banks themselves, the spaces between them, and the
breadth of the zone of dunes upon the land, the belt of
moving sands on that coast is probably not less than eight
miles wide.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances, sand banks are always rolling
landward, and they compose the magazine from which
the material for the dunes is derived. The dunes, in fact, are
but aquatic sand banks transferred to dry land. The laws of
their formation are closely analogous, because the action of the
two fluids, by which they are respectively accumulated and
built up, is very similar when brought to bear upon loose particles
of solid matter. It would, indeed, seem that the slow
and comparatively regular movements of the heavy, unelastic
water ought to affect such particles very differently from the
sudden and fitful impulses of the light and elastic air. But
the velocity of the wind currents gives them a mechanical
force approximating to that of the slower waves, and, however
difficult it may be to explain all the phenomena that characterize
the structure of the dunes, observation has proved that
it is nearly identical with that of submerged sand banks. The
differences of form are generally ascribable to the greater number
and variety of surface accidents of the ground on which
the sand hills of the land are built up, and to the more frequent
changes, and wider variety of direction, in the courses of the
wind.</p>


<h4><i>Dunes on the Coast of America.</i></h4>

<p>Upon the Atlantic coast of the United States, the prevalence
of western or off-shore winds is unfavorable to the formation
of dunes, and, though marine currents lodge vast quan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>tities
of sand, in the form of banks, on that coast, its shores are
proportionally more free from sand hills than some others of
lesser extent. There are, however, very important exceptions.
The action of the tide throws much sand upon some points of
the New England coast, as well as upon the beaches of Long
Island and other more southern shores, and here dunes resembling
those of Europe are formed. There are also extensive
ranges of dunes on the Pacific coast of the United States, and
at San Francisco they border some of the streets of the city.</p>

<p>The dunes of America are far older than her civilization,
and the soil they threaten or protect possesses, in general, too
little value to justify any great expenditure in measures for
arresting their progress or preventing their destruction.
Hence, great as is their extent and their geographical importance,
they have, at present, no such intimate relations to
human life as to render them objects of special interest in the
point of view I am taking, and I do not know that the laws
of their formation and motion have been made a subject of
original investigation by any American observer.</p>


<h4><i>Dunes of Western Europe.</i></h4>

<p>Upon the western coast of Europe, on the contrary, the
ravages occasioned by the movement of sand dunes, and the
serious consequences often resulting from the destruction of
them, have long engaged the earnest attention of governments
and of scientific men, and for nearly a century persevering and
systematic effort has been made to bring them under human
control. The subject has been carefully studied in Denmark
and the adjacent duchies, in Western Prussia, in the Netherlands,
and in France; and the experiments in the way of
arresting the drifting of the dunes, and of securing them, and
the lands they shelter, from the encroachments of the sea, have
resulted in the adoption of a system of coast improvement substantially
the same in all these countries. The sands, like the
forests, have now their special literature, and the volumes and
memoirs, which describe them and the processes employed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
subdue them, are full of scientific interest and of practical
instruction.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>


<h4><i>Formation of Dunes.</i></h4>

<p>The laws which govern the formation of dunes are substantially
these. We have seen that, under certain conditions,
sand is accumulated above high-water mark on low sea and
lake shores. So long as the sand is kept wet by the spray or
by capillary attraction, it is not disturbed by air currents, but
as soon as the waves retire sufficiently to allow it to dry, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
becomes the sport of the wind, and is driven up the gently
sloping beach until it is arrested by stones, vegetables, or other
obstructions, and thus an accumulation is formed which constitutes
the foundation of a dune. However slight the elevation
thus created, it serves to stop or retard the progress of the sand
grains which are driven against its shoreward face, and to protect
from the further influence of the wind the particles which
are borne beyond it, or rolled over its crest, and fall down
behind it. If the shore above the beach line were perfectly
level and straight, the grass or bushes upon it of equal height,
the sand thrown up by the waves uniform in size and weight
of particles as well as in distribution, and if the action of the
wind were steady and regular, a continuous bank would be
formed, everywhere alike in height and cross section. But no
such constant conditions anywhere exist. The banks are
curved, broken, unequal in elevation; they are sometimes
bare, sometimes clothed with vegetables of different structure
and dimensions; the sand thrown up is variable in quantity
and character; and the winds are shifting, gusty, vortical,
and often blowing in very narrow currents. From all these
causes, instead of uniform hills, there rise irregular rows of
sand heaps, and these, as would naturally be expected, are of
a pyramidal, or rather conical shape, and connected at bottom
by more or less continuous ridges of the same material.</p>

<p>On a receding coast, dunes will not attain so great a height
as on more secure shores, because they are undermined and
carried off before they have time to reach their greatest dimensions.
Hence, while at sheltered points in Southwestern
France, there are dunes three hundred feet or more in height,
those on the Frisic Islands and the exposed parts of the coast
of Schleswig-Holstein range only from twenty to one hundred
feet. On the western shores of Africa, it is said that they
sometimes attain an elevation of six hundred feet. This is one
of the very few points known to geographers where desert
sands are advancing seaward, and here they rise to the greatest
altitude to which sand grains can be carried by the wind.</p>

<p>The hillocks, once deposited, are held together and kept in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
shape, partly by mere gravity, and partly by the slight cohesion
of the lime, clay, and organic matter mixed with the
sand; and it is observed that, from capillary attraction, evaporation
from lower strata, and retention of rain water, they
are always moist a little below the surface.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> By successive
accumulations, they gradually rise to the height of thirty,
fifty, sixty, or a hundred feet, and sometimes even much
higher. Strong winds, instead of adding to their elevation,
sweep off loose particles from their surface, and these, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
others blown over or between them, build up a second row of
dunes, and so on according to the character of the wind, the
supply and consistence of the sand, and the face of the country.
In this way is formed a belt of sand dunes, irregularly dispersed
and varying much in height and dimensions, and some
times many miles in breadth. On the Island of Sylt, in the
German Sea, where there are several rows, the width of the
belt is from half a mile to a mile. There are similar ranges
on the coast of Holland, exceeding two miles in breadth, while
at the mouths of the Nile they form a zone not less than ten
miles wide. The base of some of the dunes in the Delta of
the Nile is reached by the river during the annual inundation,
and the infiltration of the water, which contains lime, has converted
the lower strata into a silicious limestone, or rather a
calcareous sandstone, and thus afforded an opportunity of
studying the structure of that rock in a locality where its
origin and mode of aggregation and solidification are known.</p>


<h4><i>Character of Dune Sand.</i></h4>

<p>"Dune sand," says Staring, "consists of well-rounded
grains of quartz, more or less colored by iron, and often mingled
with fragments of shells, small indeed, but still visible to
the naked eye.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> These fragments are not constant constituents
of dune sand. They are sometimes found at the very
summits of the hillocks, as at Overveen; in the King's Dune,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
near Egmond, they form a coarse calcareous gravel very
largely distributed through the sand, while the interior dunes
between Haarlem and Warmond exhibit no trace of them. It
is yet undecided whether the presence or absence of these fragments
is determined by the period of the formation of the
dunes, or whether it depends on a difference in the process by
which different dunes have been accumulated. Land shells,
such as snails, for example, are found on the surface of the
dunes in abundance, and many of the shelly fragments in
the interior of the hillocks may be derived from the same
source."<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>J. G. Kohl has some poetical thoughts upon the origin and
character of the dune sands, which are worth quoting:</p>

<p>"The sand was composed of pure transparent quartz. I
could not observe this sand without the greatest admiration.
If it is the product of the waves, breaking and crushing flints
and fragments of quartz against each other, it is a result
which could be brought about only in the course of countless
ages. We need not lift ourselves to the stars, to their incalculable
magnitudes and distances and numbers, in order to
feel the giddiness of astonishment. Here, upon earth, in the
simple sand, we find miracle enough. Think of the number
of sand grains contained in a single dune, then of all the dunes
upon this widely extended coast&mdash;not to speak of the innumerable
grains in the Arabian, African, and Prussian deserts&mdash;this,
of itself, is sufficient to overwhelm a thoughtful fancy.
How long, how many times must the waves have risen and
sunk in order to reduce these vast heaps to powder!</p>

<p>"During the whole time I spent on this coast, I had always
some sand in my fingers, was rubbing and rolling it about,
examining it on all sides, holding a little shining grain on the
tip of my finger, and thinking to myself how, in its corners,
its angles, its whole configuration, it might very probably
have a history longer than that of the old German nation&mdash;possibly
longer than that of the human race. Where was the
original quartz crystal, of which this is a fragment, first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
formed? To what was it once fixed? What power broke it
loose? How was it beaten smaller and ever smaller by the
waves? They tossed it, for &aelig;ons, to and fro upon the beach,
rolled it up and down, forced it to make thousands and thousands
of daily voyages for millions and millions of days. Then
the wind bore it away, and used it in building up a dune;
there it lay for centuries, packed in with its fellows, protecting
the marshes and cherished by the inhabitants, till, seized again
by the pursuing sea, it fell once more into the water, there to
begin the endless dance anew&mdash;and again to be swept away by
the wind&mdash;and again to find rest in the dunes, a protection
and a blessing to the coast. There is something mysterious
about such a grain of sand, and at last I went so far as to fancy
a little immortal spark linked with each one, presiding over
its destiny, and sharing its vicissitudes. Could we arm our
eyes with a microscope, and then dive, like a sparling, into
one of these dunes, the pile, which is in fact only a heap of
countless little crystal blocks, would strike us as the most marvellous
building upon earth. The sunbeams would pass, with
illuminating power, through all these little crystalline bodies.
We should see how every sand grain is formed, by what multifarious
little facets it is bounded, we should even discover
that it is itself composed of many distinct particles."<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>Sand concretions form within the dunes and especially in
the depressions between them. These are sometimes so extensive
and impervious as to retain a sufficient supply of water to
feed perennial springs, and to form small permanent ponds,
and they are a great impediment to the penetration of roots,
and consequently to the growth of trees planted, or germinating
from self-sown seeds, upon the dunes.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Interior Structure of Dunes.</i></h4>

<p>The interior structure of the dunes, the arrangement of
their particles, is not, as might be expected, that of an unorganized,
confused heap, but they show a strong tendency to
stratification. This is a point of much geological interest,
because it indicates that sandstone may owe its stratified character
to the action of wind as well as of water. The origin
and peculiar character of these layers are due to a variety of
causes. A southwest wind and current may deposit upon a
dune a stratum of a given color and mineral composition, and
this may be succeeded by a northwest wind and current,
bringing with them particles of a different hue, constitution,
and origin.</p>

<p>Again, if we suppose a violent tempest to strew the beach
with sand grains very different in magnitude and specific gravity,
and, after the sand is dry, to be succeeded by a gentle
breeze, it is evident that only the lighter particles will be
taken up and carried to the dunes. If, after some time, the
wind freshens, heavier grains will be transported and deposited
on the former, and a still stronger succeeding gale will
roll up yet larger kernels. Each of these deposits will form a
stratum. If we suppose the tempest to be followed, after the
sand is dry, not by a gentle breeze, but by a wind powerful
enough to lift at the same time particles of very various magnitudes
and weights, the heaviest will often lodge on the dune
while the lighter will be carried farther. This would produce
a stratum of coarse sand, and the same effect might result from
the blowing away of light particles out of a mixed layer, while
the heavier remained undisturbed.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Still another cause of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
stratification may be found in the occasional interposition of a
thin layer of leaves or other vegetable remains between successive
deposits, and this I imagine to be more frequent than has
been generally supposed.</p>

<p>The eddies of strong winds between the hillocks must also
occasion disturbances and re-arrangements of the sand layers,
and it seems possible that the irregular thickness and the
strange contortions of the strata of the sandstone at Petra
may be due to some such cause. A curious observation of
Professor Forchhammer suggests an explanation of another
peculiarity in the structure of the sandstone of Mount Seir.
He describes dunes in Jutland, composed of yellow quartzose
sand intermixed with black titanian iron. When the wind
blows over the surface of the dunes, it furrows the sand with
alternate ridges and depressions, ripples, in short, like those of
water. The swells, the dividing ridges of the system of sand
ripples, are composed of the light grains of quartz, while the
heavier iron rolls into the depressions between, and thus the
whole surface of the dune appears as if covered with a fine
black network.</p>


<h4><i>Form of Dunes.</i></h4>

<p>The sea side of dunes, being more exposed to the caprices
of the wind, is more irregular in form than the lee or land side,
where the arrangement of the particles is affected by fewer
disturbing and conflicting influences. Hence, the stratification
of the windward slope is somewhat confused, while the sand on
the lee side is found to be disposed in more regular beds, inclining
landward, and with the largest particles lowest,
where their greater weight would naturally carry them. The
lee side of the dunes, being thus formed of sand deposited
according to the laws of gravity, is very uniform in its slope,
which, according to Forchhammer, varies little from an angle
of 30&deg; with the horizon, while the more exposed and irregular
weather side lies at an inclination of from 5&deg; to 10&deg;. When,
however, the outer tier of dunes is formed so near the waterline
as to be exposed to the immediate action of the waves, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
is undermined, and the face of the hill is very steep and sometimes
nearly perpendicular.</p>


<h4><i>Geological Importance of Dunes.</i></h4>

<p>These observations, and other facts which a more attentive
study on the spot would detect, might furnish the means of
determining interesting and important questions concerning
geological formations in localities very unlike those where
dunes are now thrown up. For example, Studer supposes that
the drifting sand hills of the African desert were originally
coast dunes, and that they have been transported to their present
position far in the interior, by the rolling and shifting leeward
movement to which all dunes not covered with vegetation
are subject. The present general drift of the sands of that
desert appears to be to the southwest and west, the prevailing
winds blowing from the northeast and east; but it has been
doubted whether the shoals of the western coast of Northern
Africa, and the sands upon that shore, are derived from the
bottom of the Atlantic, in the usual manner, or, by an inverse
process, from those of the Sahara. The latter, as has been
before remarked, is probably the truth, though observations
are wanting to decide the question.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> There is nothing violently
improbable in the supposition that they may have been
first thrown up by the Mediterranean on its Libyan coast, and
thence blown south and west over the vast space they now
cover. But whatever has been their source and movement,
they can hardly fail to have left on their route some sandstone
monuments to mark their progress, such, for example, as we
have seen are formed from the dune sand at the mouth of the
Nile; and it is conceivable that the character of the drifting
sands themselves, and of the conglomerates and sandstones to
whose formation they have contributed, might furnish satisfac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>tory
evidence as to their origin, their starting point, and the
course by which they have wandered so far from the sea.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>If the sand of coast dunes is, as Staring describes it, composed
chiefly of well-rounded quartzose grains, fragments of
shells, and other constant ingredients, it would often be recognizable
as coast sand, in its agglutinate state of sandstone.
The texture of this rock varies from an almost imperceptible
fineness of grain to great coarseness, and affords good facilities
for microscopic observation of its structure. There are sandstones,
such, for example, as are used for grindstones, where
the grit, as it is called, is of exceeding sharpness; others where
the angles of the grains are so obtuse that they scarcely act at
all on hard metals. The former may be composed of grains
of rock, disintegrated indeed, and recemented together, but
not, in the meanwhile, much rolled; the latter, of sands long
washed by the sea, and drifted by land winds. There is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
indeed, so much resemblance between the effects of driving
winds and of rolling water upon light bodies, that there would
be difficulty in distinguishing them;<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> but after all, it is not
probable that sandstone, composed of grains thrown up from
the salt sea, and long tossed by the winds, would be identical
in its structure with that formed from fragments of rock
crushed by mechanical force, or disintegrated by heat, and
again agglutinated without much exposure to the action of
moving water.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Inland Dunes.</i></h4>

<p>I have met with some observations indicating a structural
difference between interior and coast dunes, which might perhaps
be recognized in the sandstones formed from these two
species of sand hills respectively. In the great American desert
between the Andes and the Pacific, Meyen found sand
heaps of a perfect falciform shape.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> They were from seven
to fifteen feet high, the chord of their arc measuring from twenty
to seventy paces. The slope of the convex face is described as
very small, that of the concave as high as 70&deg; or 80&deg;, and their
surfaces were rippled. No smaller dunes were observed, nor
any in the process of formation. The concave side uniformly
faced the northwest, except toward the centre of the desert,
where, for a distance of one or two hundred paces, they gradually
opened to the west, and then again gradually resumed the
former position.</p>

<p>P&ouml;ppig ascribes a falciform shape to the movable, a conical
to the fixed dunes, or <i>medanos</i>, of the same desert. "The medanos,"
he observes, "are hillock-like elevations of sand, some
having a firm, others a loose base. The former [latter], which
are always crescent shaped, are from ten to twenty feet high,
and have an acute crest. The inner side is perpendicular, and
the outer or bow side forms an angle with a steep inclination
downward. When driven by violent winds, the medanos pass
rapidly over the plains. The smaller and lighter ones move
quickly forward, before the larger; but the latter soon overtake
and crush them, whilst they are themselves shivered by the
collision. These medanos assume all sorts of extraordinary
figures, and sometimes move along the plain in rows forming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
most intricate labyrinths. * * A plain often appears to be
covered with a row of medanos, and some days afterward it
is again restored to its level and uniform aspect. * * *</p>

<p>"The medanos with immovable bases are formed on the
blocks of rocks which are scattered about the plain. The sand
is driven against them by the wind, and as soon as it reaches
the top point, it descends on the other side until that is likewise
covered; thus gradually arises a conical-formed hill. Entire
hillock chains with acute crests are formed in a similar manner.
* * * On their southern declivities are found vast masses
of sand, drifted thither by the mid-day gales. The northern
declivity, though not steeper than the southern, is only sparingly
covered with sand. If a hillock chain somewhat distant
from the sea extends in a line parallel with the Andes, namely,
from S. S. E. to N. N. W., the western declivity is almost entirely
free of sand, as it is driven to the plain below by the
southeast wind, which constantly alternates with the wind from
the south."<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to reconcile this description with that of Meyen,
but if confidence is to be reposed in the accuracy of either
observer, the formation of the sand hills in question must be
governed by very different laws from those which determine
the structure of coast dunes. Captain Gilliss, of the American
navy, found the sand hills of the Peruvian desert to be in general
crescent shaped, as described by Meyen, and a similar
structure is said to characterize the inland dunes of the Llano
Estacado and other plateaus of the North American desert,
though these latter are of greater height and other dimensions
than those described by Meyen. There is no very obvious explanation
of this difference in form between maritime and
inland sand hills, and the subject merits investigation.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Age, Character, and Permanence of Dunes.</i></h4>

<p>The origin of most great lines of dunes goes back past all
history. There are on many coasts, several distinct ranges of
sand hills which seem to be of very different ages, and to have
been formed under different relative conditions of land and
water.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> In some cases, there has been an upheaval of the coast
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>line since the formation of the oldest hillocks, and these have
become inland dunes, while younger rows have been thrown
up on the new beach laid bare by elevation of the sea bed.
Our knowledge of the mode of their first accumulation is derived
from observation of the action of wind and water in the
few instances where, with or without the aid of man, new
coast dunes have been accumulated, and of the influence of
wind alone in elevating new sand heaps inland of the coast
tier, when the outer rows are destroyed by the sea, as also
when the sodded surface of ancient sands has been broken, and
the subjacent strata laid open to the air.</p>

<p>It is a question of much interest, in what degree the naked
condition of most dunes is to be ascribed to the improvidence
and indiscretion of man. There are, in Western France, extensive
ranges of dunes covered with ancient and dense forests,
while the recently formed sand hills between them and the sea
are bare of vegetation, and are rapidly advancing upon the
wooded dunes, which they threaten to bury beneath their
drifts. Between the old dunes and the new, there is no discoverable
difference in material or in structure; but the modern
sand hills are naked and shifting, the ancient, clothed with
vegetation and fixed. It has been conjectured that artificial
methods of confinement and plantation were employed by the
primitive inhabitants of Gaul; and Laval, basing his calculations
on the rate of annual movement of the shifting dunes,
assigns the fifth century of the Christian era as the period when
these processes were abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>There is no historical evidence that the Gauls were acquainted
with artificial methods of fixing the sands of the
coast, and we have little reason to suppose that they were advanced
enough in civilization to be likely to resort to such
processes, especially at a period when land could have had but
a moderate value.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span></p>

<p>In other countries, dunes have spontaneously clothed themselves
with forests, and the rapidity with which their surface
is covered by various species of sand plants, and finally by
trees, where man and cattle and burrowing animals are excluded
from them, renders it highly probable that they would,
as a general rule, protect themselves, if left to the undisturbed
action of natural causes. The sand hills of the Frische Nehrung,
on the coast of Prussia, were formerly wooded down to
the water's edge, and it was only in the last century that, in
consequence of the destruction of their forests, they became
moving sands.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> There is every reason to believe that the
dunes of the Netherlands were clothed with trees until after
the Roman invasion. The old geographers, in describing these
countries, speak of vast forests extending to the very brink of
the sea; but drifting coast dunes are first mentioned by the
chroniclers of the Middle Ages, and so far as we know they
have assumed a destructive character in consequence of the
improvidence of man.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> The history of the dunes of Michigan,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
so far as I have been able to learn from my own observation,
or that of others, is the same. Thirty years ago, when that
region was scarcely inhabited, they were generally covered
with a thick growth of trees, chiefly pines, and underwood, and
there was little appearance of undermining and wash on the
lake side, or of shifting of the sands, except where the trees
had been cut or turned up by the roots.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>Nature, as she builds up dunes for the protection of the sea
shore, provides, with similar conservatism, for the preservation
of the dunes themselves; so that, without the interference of
man, these hillocks would be, not perhaps absolutely perpetual,
but very lasting in duration, and very slowly altered in form or
position. When once covered with the trees, shrubs, and herbaceous
growths adapted to such localities, dunes undergo no
apparent change, except the slow occasional undermining of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
the outer tier, and accidental destruction by the exposure of
the interior, from the burrowing of animals, or the upturning
of trees with their roots, and all these causes of displacement
are very much less destructive when a vegetable covering exists
in the immediate neighborhood of the breach.</p>

<p>Before the occupation of the coasts by civilized and therefore
destructive man, dunes, at all points where they have been
observed, seem to have been protected in their rear by forests,
which served to break the force of the winds in both directions,<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
and to have spontaneously clothed themselves with a dense
growth of the various plants, grasses, shrubs, and trees, which
nature has assigned to such soils. It is observed in Europe
that dunes, though now without the shelter of a forest country
behind them, begin to protect themselves as soon as human
trespassers are excluded, and grazing animals denied access to
them. Herbaceous and arborescent plants spring up almost at
once, first in the depressions, and then upon the surface of the
sand hills. Every seed that sprouts, binds together a certain
amount of sand by its roots, shades a little ground with its
leaves, and furnishes food and shelter for still younger or
smaller growths. A succession of a very few favorable seasons
suffices to bind the whole surface together with a vegetable
network, and the power of resistance possessed by the dunes
themselves, and the protection they afford to the fields behind
them, are just in proportion to the abundance and density of
the plants they support.</p>

<p>The growth of the vegetable covering can, of course, be
much accelerated by judicious planting and watchful care, and
this species of improvement is now carried on upon a vast
scale, wherever the value of land is considerable and the population
dense. In the main, the dunes on the coast of the
German Sea, notwithstanding the great quantity of often fertile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
land they cover, and the evils which result from their movement,
are, upon the whole, a protective and beneficial agent,
and their maintenance is an object of solicitude with the governments
and people of the shores they protect.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>


<h4><i>Use of Dunes as a Barrier against the Sea.</i></h4>

<p>Although the sea throws up large quantities of sand on flat
lee-shores, there are, as we have seen, many cases where it
continually encroaches on those same shores and washes them
away. At all points of the shallow North Sea where the
agitation of the waves extends to the bottom, banks are forming
and rolling eastward. Hence the sea sand tends to accumulate
upon the coast of Schleswig-Holstein and Jutland, and
were there no conflicting influences, the shore would rapidly
extend itself westward. But the same waves which wash
the sand to the coast undermine the beach they cover, and still
more rapidly degrade the shore at points where it is too high
to receive partial protection by the formation of dunes upon
it. The earth of the coast is generally composed of particles
finer, lighter, and more transportable by water than the sea
sand. While, therefore, the billows raised by a heavy west
wind may roll up and deposit along the beach thousands of
tons of sand, the same waves may swallow up even a larger
quantity of fine shore earth. This earth, with a portion of the
sand, is swept off by northwardly and southwardly currents,
and let fall at other points of the coast, or carried off, altogether,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
out of the reach of causes which might bring it back to its
former position.</p>

<p>Although, then, the eastern shore of the German Ocean
here and there advances into the sea, it in general retreats
before it, and but for the protection afforded it by natural
arrangements seconded by the art and industry of man, whole
provinces would soon be engulfed by the waters. This protection
consists in an almost unbroken chain of sand banks and
dunes, extending from the northernmost point of Jutland to
the Elbe, a distance of not much less than three hundred miles,
and from the Elbe again, though with more frequent and wider
interruptions, to the Atlantic borders of France and Spain.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
So long as the dunes are maintained by nature or by human
art, they serve, like any other embankment or dike, as a partial
or a complete protection against the encroachments of the sea;
and on the other hand, when their drifts are not checked by
natural processes, or by the industry of man, they become a
cause of as certain, if not of as sudden, destruction as the
ocean itself whose advance they retard.</p>


<h4><i>Encroachments of the Sea.</i></h4>

<p>The eastward progress of the sea on the Danish and Netherlandish
coast, and on certain shores of the Atlantic, depends so
much on local geological structure, on the force and direction
of tidal and other marine currents, on the volume and rapidity
of coast rivers, on the contingencies of the weather and on
other varying circumstances, that no general rate can he assigned
to it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span></p>

<p>At Agger, near the western end of the Liimfjord, in Jutland,
the coast was washed away, between the years 1815 and
1839, at the rate of more than eighteen feet a year. The advance
of the sea appears to have been something less rapid
for a century before; but from 1840 to 1857, it gained upon
the land no less than thirty feet a year. At other points of
the shore of Jutland, the loss is smaller, but the sea is encroaching
generally upon the whole line of the coast.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>


<h4><i>The Liimfjord.</i></h4>

<p>The irruption of the sea into the fresh-water lagoon of
Liimfjord in Jutland, in 1825&mdash;one of the most remarkable
encroachments of the ocean in modern times&mdash;is expressly ascribed
to "mismanagement of the dunes" on the narrow neck
of land which separated the fjord from the North Sea. At
earlier periods, the sea had swept across the isthmus, and even
burst through it, but the channel had been filled up again,
sometimes by artificial means, sometimes by the operation of
natural causes, and on all these occasions effects were produced
very similar to those resulting from the formation of the new
channel in 1825, which still remains open.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> Within comparatively
recent historical ages, the Liimfjord has thus been several
times alternately filled with fresh and with salt water, and man
has produced, by neglecting the dunes, or at least might have
prevented by maintaining them, changes identical with those
which are usually ascribed to the action of great geological
causes, and sometimes supposed to have required vast periods
of time for their accomplishment.</p>

<p>"This breach," says Forchhammer, "which converted the
Liimfjord into a sound, and the northern part of Jutland into
an island, occasioned remarkable changes. The first and most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
striking phenomenon was the sudden destruction of almost all
the fresh-water fish previously inhabiting this lagoon, which
was famous for its abundant fisheries. Millions of fresh-water
fish were thrown on shore, partly dead and partly dying, and
were carted off by the people. A few only survived, and still
frequent the shores at the mouth of the brooks. The eel,
however, has gradually accommodated itself to the change of
circumstances, and is found in all parts of the fjord, while to
all other fresh-water fish, the salt water of the ocean seems to
have been fatal. It is more than probable that the sand washed
in by the irruption covers, in many places, a layer of dead fish,
and has thus prepared the way for a petrified stratum similar
to those observed in so many older formations.</p>

<p>"As it seems to be a law of nature that animals whose life
is suddenly extinguished while yet in full vigor, are the most
likely to be preserved by petrification, we find here one of the
conditions favorable to the formation of such a petrified stratum.
The bottom of the Liimfjord was covered with a vigorous
growth of aquatic plants, belonging both to fresh and to salt
water, especially <i>Zostera marina</i>. This vegetation totally
disappeared after the irruption, and, in some instances, was
buried by the sand; and here again we have a familiar phenomenon
often observed in ancient strata&mdash;the indication of
a given formation by a particular vegetable species&mdash;and when
the strata deposited at the time of the breach shall be accessible
by upheaval, the period of eruption will be marked by a
stratum of <i>Zostera</i>, and probably by impressions of fresh-water
fishes.</p>

<p>"It is very remarkable that the <i>Zostera marina</i>, a sea plant,
was destroyed even where no sand was deposited. This was
probably in consequence of the sudden change from brackish to
salt water. * * It is well established that the Liimfjord
communicated with the German Ocean at some former period.
To that era belong the deep beds of oyster shells and <i>Cardium
edule</i>, which are still found at the bottom of the fjord. And
now, after an interval of centuries, during which the lagoon
contained no salt-water shell fish, it again produces great num<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>bers
of <i>Mytilus edulis</i>. Could we obtain a deep section of the
bottom, we should find beds of <i>Ostrea edulis</i> and <i>Cardium
edule</i>, then a layer of <i>Zostera marina</i> with fresh-water fish,
and then a bed of <i>Mytilus edulis</i>. If, in course of time, the
new channel should be closed, the brooks would fill the lagoon
again with fresh water; fresh-water fish and shell fish would
reappear, and thus we should have a repeated alternation
of organic inhabitants of the sea and of the waters of the
land.</p>

<p>"These events have been accompanied with but a comparatively
insignificant change of land surface, while the formations
in the bed of this inland sea have been totally revolutionized
in character."<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>


<h4><i>Coasts of Schleswig-Holstein, Holland, and France.</i></h4>

<p>On the islands on the coast of Schleswig-Holstein, the advance
of the sea has been more unequivocal and more rapid.
Near the beginning of the last century, the dunes which had
protected the western coast of the island of Sylt began to roll
to the east, and the sea followed closely as they retired. In
1757, the church of Rantum, a village upon that island, was
obliged to be taken down in consequence of the advance of the
sand hills; in 1791, these hills had passed beyond its site, the
waves had swallowed up its foundations, and the sea gained so
rapidly, that, fifty years later, the spot where they lay was
seven hundred feet from the shore.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>The most prominent geological landmark on the coast of
Holland is the Huis te Britten, <i>Arx Britannica</i>, a fortress
built by the Romans, in the time of Caligula, on the main
land near the mouth of the Rhine. At the close of the seventeenth
century, the sea had advanced sixteen hundred paces
beyond it. The older Dutch annalists record, with much parade
of numerical accuracy, frequent encroachments of the sea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
upon many parts of the Netherlandish coast. But though the
general fact of an advance of the ocean upon the land is established
beyond dispute, the precision of the measurements
which have been given is open to question. Staring, however,
who thinks the erosion of the coast much exaggerated by popular
geographers, admits a loss of more than a million and a
half acres, chiefly worthless morass;<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> and it is certain that
but for the resistance of man, but for his erection of dikes and
protection of dunes, there would now be left of Holland little
but the name. It is, as has been already seen, still a debated
question among geologists whether the coast of Holland now
is, and for centuries has been, subsiding. I believe most investigators
maintain the affirmative; and if the fact is so, the
advance of the sea upon the land is, in part, due to this cause.
But the rate of subsidence is at all events very small, and
therefore the encroachments of the ocean upon the coast are
mainly to be ascribed to the erosion and transportation of the
soil by marine waves and currents.</p>

<p>The sea is fast advancing at several points of the western
coast of France, and unknown causes have given a new impulse
to its ravages since the commencement of the present century.
Between 1830 and 1842, the Point de Grave, on the north side
of the Gironde, retreated one hundred and eighty m&egrave;tres, or
about fifty feet per year; from the latter year to 1846, the rate
was increased to more than three times that quantity, and the
loss in those four years was above six hundred feet. All the
buildings at the extremity of the peninsula have been taken
down and rebuilt farther landward, and the lighthouse of the
Grave now occupies its third position. The sea attacked the
base of the peninsula also, and the Point de Grave and the adjacent
coasts have been for twenty years the scene of one of
the most obstinately contested struggles between man and the
ocean recorded in the annals of modern engineering.</p>

<p>It cannot, indeed, be affirmed that human power is able to
arrest altogether the incursions of the waves on sandy coasts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
by planting the beach, and clothing the dunes with wood. On
the contrary, both in Holland and on the French coast, it has
been found necessary to protect the dunes themselves by piling
and by piers and sea walls of heavy masonry. But experience
has amply shown that the processes referred to are entirely
successful in preventing the movement of the dunes, and the
drifting of their sands over cultivated lands behind them; and
that, at the same time, the plantations very much retard the
landward progress of the waters.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>


<h4><i>Drifting of Dune Sands.</i></h4>

<p>Besides their importance as a barrier against the inroads
of the ocean, dunes are useful by sheltering the cultivated
ground behind them from the violence of the sea wind, from
salt spray, and from the drifts of beach sand which would
otherwise overwhelm them. But the dunes themselves, unless
their surface sands are kept moist, and confined by the growth
of plants, or at least by a crust of vegetable earth, are constantly
rolling inward; and thus, while, on one side, they lay
bare the traces of ancient human habitations or other evidences
of the social life of primitive man, they are, on the other, burying
fields, houses, churches, and converting populous districts
into barren and deserted wastes.</p>

<p>Especially destructive are they when, by any accident, a
cavity is opened into them to a considerable depth, thereby
giving the wind access to the interior, where the sand is thus
first dried, and then scooped out and scattered far over the
neighboring soil. The dune is now a magazine of sand, no
longer a rampart against it, and mischief from this source
seems more difficult to resist than from almost any other drift,
because the supply of material at the command of the wind, is
more abundant and more concentrated than in its original thin
and widespread deposits on the beach. The burrowing of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
conies in the dunes is, in this way, not unfrequently a cause of
their destruction and of great injury to the fields behind them.
Drifts, and even inland sand hills, sometimes result from breaking
the surface of more level sand deposits, far within the
range of the coast dunes. Thus we learn from Staring, that
one of the highest inland dunes in Friesland owes its origin to
the opening of the drift sand by the uprooting of a large oak.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>Great as are the ravages produced by the encroachment of
the sea upon the western shores of continental Europe, they
have been in some degree compensated by spontaneous marine
deposits at other points of the coast, and we have seen in a
former chapter that the industry of man has reclaimed a large
territory from the bosom of the ocean. These latter triumphs
are not of recent origin, and the incipient victories which paved
the way for them date back perhaps as far as ten centuries.
In the mean time, the dunes had been left to the operation of
the laws of nature, or rather freed, by human imprudence,
from the fetters with which nature had bound them, and it is
scarcely three generations since man first attempted to check
their destructive movements. As they advanced, he unresistingly
yielded and retreated before them, and they have buried
under their sandy billows many hundreds of square miles of
luxuriant cornfields and vineyards and forests.</p>


<h4><i>Dunes of Gascony.</i></h4>

<p>On the west coast of France, a belt of dunes, varying in
width from a quarter of a mile to five miles, extends from the
Adour to the estuary of the Gironde, and covers an area of
three hundred and seventy-five square miles. When not fixed
by vegetable growths, they advance eastward at a mean rate
of about one rod, or sixteen and a half feet, a year. We do
not know historically when they began to drift, but if we suppose
their motion to have been always the same as at present,
they would have passed over the space between the sea coast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
and their eastern boundary, and covered the large area above
mentioned, in fourteen hundred years. We know, from written
records, that they have buried extensive fields and forests
and thriving villages, and changed the courses of rivers, and
that the lighter particles carried from them by the winds, even
where not transported in sufficient quantities to form sand
hills, have rendered sterile much land formerly fertile.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> They
have also injuriously obstructed the natural drainage of the
maritime districts by choking up the beds of the streams, and
forming lakes and pestilential swamps of no inconsiderable extent.
In fact, so completely do they embank the coast, that
between the Gironde and the village of Mimizan, a distance of
one hundred miles, there are but two outlets for the discharge
of all the waters which flow from the land to the sea; and the
eastern front of the dunes is bordered by a succession of stagnant
pools, some of which are more than six miles in length
and breadth.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>


<h4><i>The Dunes of Denmark and Prussia.</i></h4>

<p>In the small kingdom of Denmark, inclusive of the duchies
of Schleswig and Holstein, the dunes cover an area of more
than two hundred and sixty square miles. The breadth of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
chain is very various, and in some places it consists only of a
single row of sand hills, while in others, it is more than six
miles wide. The general rate of eastward movement of the
drifting dunes is from three to twenty-four feet per annum.
If we adopt the mean of thirteen feet and a half for the annual
motion, the dunes have traversed the widest part of the belt in
about twenty-five hundred years. Historical data are wanting
as to the period of the formation of these dunes and of the
commencement of their drifting; but there is recorded evidence
that they have buried a vast extent of valuable land
within three or four centuries, and further proof is found in
the fact that the movement of the sands is constantly uncovering
ruins of ancient buildings, and other evidences of human
occupation, at points far within the present limits of the uninhabitable
desert. Andresen estimates the average depth of the
sand deposited over this area at thirty feet, which would give
a cubic mile and a half for the total quantity.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

<p>The drifting of the dunes on the coast of Prussia commenced
not much more than a hundred years ago. The
Frische Nehrung is separated from the mainland by the
Frische Haff, and there is but a narrow strip of arable land
along its eastern borders. Hence its rolling sands have covered
a comparatively small extent of dry land, but fields and villages
have been buried and valuable forests laid waste by
them. The loose coast row has drifted over the inland ranges,
which, as was noticed in the description of these dunes on a
former page, were protected by a surface of different composition,
and the sand has thus been raised to a height which it
could not have reached upon level ground. This elevation has
enabled it to advance upon and overwhelm woods, which, upon
a plain, would have checked its progress, and, in one instance,
a forest of many hundred acres of tall pines was destroyed by
the drifts between 1804 and 1827.</p>


<h4><i>Control of Dunes by Man.</i></h4>

<p>There are three principal modes in which the industry of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
man is brought to bear upon the dunes. First, the creation of
them, at points where, from changes in the currents or other
causes, new encroachments of the sea are threatened; second,
the maintenance and protection of them where they have been
naturally formed; and third, the removal of the inner rows
where the belt is so broad that no danger is to be apprehended
from the loss of them.</p>


<h4><i>Artificial Formation of Dunes.</i></h4>

<p>In describing the natural formation of dunes, it was said
that they began with an accumulation of sand around some
vegetable or other accidental obstruction to the drifting of the
particles. A high, perpendicular cliff, which deadens the wind
altogether, prevents all accumulation of sand; but, up to a
certain point, the higher and broader the obstruction, the more
sand will heap up in front of it, and the more will that which
falls behind it be protected from drifting farther. This familiar
observation has taught the inhabitants of the coast that an
artificial wall or dike will, in many situations, give rise to a
broad belt of dunes. Thus a sand dike or wall, of three or four
miles in length, thrown in 1610 across the Koegras, a tide-washed
flat between the Zuiderzee and the North Sea, has
occasioned the formation of rows of dunes a mile in breadth,
and thus excluded the sea altogether from the Koegras. A
similar dike, called the Zijperzeedijk, has produced another
scarcely less extensive belt in the course of two centuries.</p>

<p>A few years since, the sea was threatening to cut through
the island of Ameland, and, by encroachment on the southern
side and the blowing off of the sand from a low flat which connected
the two higher parts of the island, it had made such
progress, that in heavy storms the waves sometimes rolled
quite across the isthmus. The construction of a breakwater
and a sand dike have already checked the advance of the sea,
and a large number of sand hills has been formed, the rapid
growth of which promises complete future security against
both wind and wave. Similar effects have been produced by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
the erection of plank fences, and even of simple screens of
wattling and reeds.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>


<h4><i>Protection of Dunes.</i></h4>

<p>The dunes of Holland are sometimes protected from the
dashing of the waves by a <i>rev&ecirc;tement</i> of stone, or by piles;
and the lateral high-water currents, which wash away their
base, are occasionally checked by transverse walls running
from the foot of the dunes to low-water mark; but the great
expense of such constructions has prevented their adoption on
a large scale.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> The principal means relied on for the protection
of the sand hills are the planting of their surfaces and
the exclusion of burrowing and grazing animals. There are
grasses, creeping plants, and shrubs of spontaneous growth,
which flourish in loose sand, and, if protected, spread over considerable
tracts, and finally convert their face into a soil capable
of cultivation, or, at least, of producing forest trees.
Krause enumerates one hundred and seventy-one plants as
native to the coast sands of Prussia, and the observations of
Andresen in Jutland carry the number of these vegetables up
to two hundred and thirty-four.</p>

<p>Some of these plants, especially the <i>Arundo arenaria</i> or
<i>arenosa</i>, or <i>Psamma</i> or <i>Psammophila arenaria</i>&mdash;Klittetag, or
Hjelme in Danish, helm in Dutch, D&uuml;nenhalm, Sandschilf, or
H&uuml;gelrohr in German, gourbet in French, and marram in
English&mdash;are exclusively confined to sandy soils, and thrive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
well only in a saline atmosphere.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> The arundo grows to the
height of about twenty-four inches, but sends its strong roots
with their many rootlets to a distance of forty or fifty feet. It
has the peculiar property of nourishing best in the loosest soil,
and a sand shower seems to refresh it as the rain revives the
thirsty plants of the common earth. Its roots bind together the
dunes, and its leaves protect their surface. When the sand
ceases to drift, the arundo dies, its decaying roots fertilizing
the sand, and the decomposition of its leaves forming a layer
of vegetable earth over it. Then follows a succession of other
plants which gradually fit the sand hills, by growth and decay,
for forest planting, for pasturage, and sometimes for ordinary
agricultural use.</p>

<p>But the protection and gradual transformation of the dunes
is not the only service rendered by this valuable plant. Its
leaves are nutritious food for sheep and cattle, its seeds for
poultry;<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> cordage and netting twine are manufactured from
its fibres, it makes a good material for thatching, and its dried
roots furnish excellent fuel. These useful qualities, unfortunately,
are too often prejudicial to its growth. The peasants
feed it down with their cattle, cut it for rope making, or dig it
up for fuel, and it has been found necessary to resort to severe
legislation to prevent them from bringing ruin upon themselves
by thus improvidently sacrificing their most effectual
safeguard against the drifting of the sands.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p>In 1539, a decree of Christian III, king of Denmark, imposed
a fine upon persons convicted of destroying certain species
of sand plants upon the west coast of Jutland. This ordinance
was renewed and made more comprehensive in 1558,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
and in 1569 the inhabitants of several districts were required,
by royal rescript, to do their best to check the sand drifts,
though the specific measures to be adopted for that purpose
are not indicated. Various laws against stripping the dunes
of their vegetation were enacted in the following century, but
no active measures were taken for the subjugation of the sand
drifts until 1779, when a preliminary system of operation for
that purpose was adopted. This consisted in little more than
the planting of the <i>Arundo arenaria</i> and other sand plants,
and the exclusion of animals destructive to these vegetables.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
Ten years later, plantations of forest trees, which have since
proved so valuable a means of fixing the dunes and rendering
them productive, were commenced, and have been continued
ever since.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> During this latter period, Br&eacute;montier, without
any knowledge of what was doing in Denmark, experimented
upon the cultivation of forest trees on the dunes of Gascony,
and perfected a system, which, with some improvements in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
matters of detail, is still largely pursued on those shores. The
example of Denmark was soon followed in the neighboring
kingdom of Prussia, and in the Netherlands; and, as we shall
see hereafter, these improvements have been everywhere
crowned with most flattering success.</p>

<p>Under the administration of Reventlov, a little before the
close of the last century, the Danish Government organized a
regular system of improvement in the economy of the dunes.
They were planted with the arundo and other vegetables of
similar habits, protected against trespassers, and at last partly
covered with forest trees. By these means much waste soil has
been converted into arable ground, a large growth of valuable
timber obtained, and the further spread of the drifts, which
threatened to lay waste the whole peninsula of Jutland, to a
considerable extent arrested.</p>

<p>In France, the operations for fixing and reclaiming the
dunes&mdash;which began under the direction of Br&eacute;montier about
the same time as in Denmark, and which are, in principle and
in many of their details, similar to those employed in the latter
kingdom&mdash;have been conducted on a far larger scale, and with
greater success, than in any other country. This is partly
owing to a climate more favorable to the growth of suitable
forest trees than that of Northern Europe, and partly to the
liberality of the Government, which, having more important
landed interests to protect, has put larger means at the disposal
of the engineers than Denmark and Prussia have found it convenient
to appropriate to that purpose. The area of the dunes
already secured from drifting, and planted by the processes invented
by Br&eacute;montier and perfected by his successors, is about
100,000 acres.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> This amount of productive soil, then, has been
added to the resources of France, and a still greater quantity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
of valuable land has been thereby rescued from the otherwise
certain destruction with which it was threatened by the advance
of the rolling sand hills.</p>

<p>The improvements of the dunes on the coast of West Prussia
began in 1795, under S&ouml;ren Bj&ouml;rn, a native of Denmark, and,
with the exception of the ten years between 1807 and 1817,
they have been prosecuted ever since. The methods do not
differ essentially from those employed in Denmark and France,
though they are modified by local circumstances, and, with
respect to the trees selected for planting, by climate. In 1850,
between the mouth of the Vistula and Kahlberg, 6,300 acres,
including about 1,900 acres planted with pines and birches,
had been secured from drifting; between Kahlberg and the
eastern boundary of West-Prussia, 8,000 acres; and important
preliminary operations had been carried on for subduing the
dunes on the west coast.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>


<h4><i>Trees suited to Dune Plantations.</i></h4>

<p>The tree which has been found to thrive best upon the
sand hills of the French coast, and at the same time to confine
the sand most firmly and yield the largest pecuniary returns,
is the maritime pine, <i>Pinus maritima</i>, a species valuable both
for its timber and for its resinous products. It is always grown
from seed, and the young shoots require to be protected for
several seasons, by the branches of other trees, planted in rows,
or spread over the surface and staked down, by the growth of
the <i>Arundo arenaria</i> and other small sand plants, or by wattled
hedges. The beach, from which the sand is derived, has
been generally planted with the arundo, because the pine does
not thrive well so near the sea; but it is thought that a species
of tamarisk is likely to succeed in that latitude even better
than the arundo. The shade and the protection offered by the
branching top of this pine are favorable to the growth of deciduous
trees, and, while still young, of shrubs and smaller plants,
which contribute more rapidly to the formation of vegetable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
mould, and thus, when the pine has once taken root, the redemption
of the waste is considered as effectually secured.</p>

<p>In France, the maritime pine is planted on the sands of the
interior as well as on the dunes of the sea coast, and with equal
advantage. This tree resembles the pitch pine of the Southern
American States in its habits, and is applied to the same uses.
The extraction of turpentine from it begins at the age of about
twenty years, or when it has attained a diameter of from nine
to twelve inches. Incisions are made up and down the trunk,
to the depth of about half an inch in the wood, and it is insisted
that if not more than two such slits are cut, the tree is not
sensibly injured by the process. The growth, indeed, is somewhat
checked, but the wood becomes superior to that of trees
from which the turpentine is not extracted. Thus treated, the
pine continues to flourish to the age of one hundred or one
hundred and twenty years, and up to this age the trees on a
hectare yield annually 350 kilogrammes of essence of turpentine,
and 280 kilogrammes of resin, worth together 110 francs.
The expense of extraction and distillation is calculated at 44
francs, and a clear profit of 66 francs per hectare, or more than
five dollars per acre, is left.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> This is exclusive of the value of
the timber, when finally cut, which, of course, amounts to a
very considerable sum.</p>

<p>In Denmark, where the climate is much colder, hardier
conifers, as well as the birch and other northern trees, are
found to answer a better purpose than the maritime pine, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
it is doubtful whether this tree would be able to resist the winter
on the dunes of Massachusetts. Probably the pitch pine of
the Northern States, in conjunction with some of the American
oaks, birches, and poplars, and especially the robinia or locust,
would prove very suitable to be employed on the sand hills of
Cape Cod and Long Island. The ailanthus, now coming into
notice as a sand-loving tree, may, perhaps, serve a better purpose
than any of them.</p>


<h4><i>Extent of Dunes in Europe.</i></h4>

<p>The dunes of Denmark, as we have seen, cover an area of
two hundred and sixty square miles, or one hundred and
sixty-six thousand acres; those of the Prussian coast are
vaguely estimated at from eighty-five to one hundred and ten
thousand acres; those of Holland at one hundred and forty
thousand acres;<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> those of Gascony at about three hundred
thousand acres.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> I do not find any estimate of their extent in
other provinces of France, in the duchies of Schleswig and
Holstein, or in the Baltic provinces of Russia, but it is probable
that the entire quantity of dune land upon the eastern shores
of the Atlantic and the Baltic does not fall much short of a
million of acres.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> This vast deposit of sea sand extends along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
the coast for a distance of several hundred miles, and from the
time of the destruction of the forests which covered it, to the
year 1789, the whole line was rolling inward and burying the
soil beneath it, or rendering the fields unproductive by the
sand which drifted from it. At the same time, as the sand
hills moved eastward, the ocean was closely following their
retreat and swallowing up the ground they had covered, as
fast as their movement left it bare.</p>

<p>Planting the dunes has completely prevented the surface
sands from blowing over the soil to the leeward of the plantations,
and though it has not, in all cases, arrested the encroachments
of the sea, it has so greatly retarded the rapidity of their
advance, that sandy coasts, when once covered with forests,
may be considered as substantially secure, so long as proper
measures are taken for the protection of the woods.</p>


<h4><i>Dune Vineyards of Cap Breton.</i></h4>

<p>In the vicinity of Cap Breton in France, a peculiar process
is successfully employed, both for preventing the drifting of
dunes, and for rendering the sands themselves immediately
productive; but this method is applicable only in exceptional
cases of favorable climate and exposure. It consists in planting
vineyards upon the dunes, and protecting them by hedges
of broom, <i>Erica scoparia</i>, so disposed as to form rectangles
about thirty feet by forty. The vines planted in these enclosures
thrive admirably, and the grapes produced by them are
among the best grown in France. The dunes are so far from
being an unfavorable soil for the vine, that fresh sea-sand is
regularly employed as a fertilizer for it, alternating every other
season with ordinary manure. The quantity of sand thus applied
every second year, raises the surface of the vineyard
about four or five inches. The vines are cut down every year
to three or four shoots, and the raising of the soil rapidly cov<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>ers
the old stocks. As fast as buried, they send out new roots
near the surface, and thus the vineyard is constantly renewed,
and has always a youthful appearance, though it may have
been already planted a couple of generations. This practice is
ascertained to have been followed for two centuries, and is
among the oldest well-authenticated attempts of man to resist
and vanquish the dunes.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>


<h4><i>Removal of Dunes.</i></h4>

<p>The artificial removal of dunes, no longer necessary as a
protection, does not appear to have been practised upon a large
scale except in the Netherlands, where the numerous canals
furnish an easy and economical means of transporting the
sand, and where the construction and maintenance of sea and
river dikes, and of causeways and other embankments and
fillings, create a great demand for that material. Sand is also
employed in Holland, in large quantities, for improving the
consistence of the tough clay bordering upon or underlying
diluvial deposits, and for forming an artificial soil for the
growth of certain garden and ornamental vegetables. When
the dunes are removed, the ground they covered is restored to
the domain of industry; and the quantity of land, recovered
in the Netherlands by the removal of the barren sands which
encumbered it, amounts to hundreds and perhaps thousands of
acres.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>


<h4><i>Inland Sand Plains.</i></h4>

<p>The inland sand plains of Europe are either derived from
the drifting of dunes or other beach sands, or consist of diluvial
deposits. As we have seen, when once the interior of a dune
is laid open to the wind, its contents are soon scattered far and
wide over the adjacent country, and the beach sands, no longer
checked by the rampart which nature had constrained them to
build against their own encroachments, are also carried to con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>siderable
distances from the coast. Few regions have suffered
so much from this cause in proportion to their extent, as the
peninsula of Jutland. So long as the woods, with which nature
had planted the Danish dunes, were spared, they seem to have
been stationary, and we have no historical evidence, of an earlier
date than the sixteenth century, that they had become in any
way injurious. From that period, there are frequent notices of
the invasions of cultivated grounds by the sands; and excavations
are constantly bringing to light proof of human habitation
and of agricultural industry, in former ages, on soils now
buried beneath deep drifts from the dunes and beaches of the
sea coast.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

<p>Extensive tracts of valuable plain land in the Netherlands
and in France have been covered in the same way with a layer
of sand deep enough to render them infertile, and they can be
restored to cultivation only by processes analogous to those
employed for fixing and improving the dunes.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> Diluvial sand
plains, also, have been reclaimed by these methods in the
Duchy of Austria, between Vienna and the Semmering ridge,
in Jutland, and in the great champaign country of Northern
Germany, especially the Mark Brandenburg, where artificial
forests can be propagated with great ease, and where, consequently,
this branch of industry has been pursued on a great
scale, and with highly beneficial results, both as respects the
supply of forest products and the preparation of the soil for
agricultural use.</p>

<p>As a general rule, inland sands are looser, dryer, and more
inclined to drift, than those of the sea coast, where the moist
and saline atmosphere of the ocean keeps them always more
or less humid and cohesive. No shore dunes are so movable
as the medanos of Peru described in a passage quoted from P&ouml;p<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>pig
on a former page, or as the sand hills of Poland, both of
which seem better entitled to the appellation of sand waves than
those of the Sahara or of the Arabian desert. The sands of
the valley of the Lower Euphrates&mdash;themselves probably of
submarine origin, and not derived from dunes&mdash;are advancing
to the northwest with a rapidity which seems fabulous when
compared with the slow movement of the sand hills of Gascony
and the Low German coasts. Loftus, speaking of Niliyya, an
old Arab town a few miles east of the ruins of Babylon, says
that, "in 1848, the sand began to accumulate around it, and in
six years, the desert, within a radius of six miles, was covered
with little, undulating domes, while the ruins of the city were
so buried that it is now impossible to trace their original form
or extent."<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Loftus considers this sand flood as the "vanguard
of those vast drifts which, advancing from the southeast,
threaten eventually to overwhelm Babylon and Baghdad."</p>

<p>An observation of Layard, cited by Loftus, appears to me
to furnish a possible explanation of this irruption. He "passed
two or three places where the sand, issuing from the earth
like water, is called 'Aioun-er-rummal,' sand springs." These
"springs" are very probably merely the drifting of sand from
the ancient subsoil, where the protecting crust of aquatic deposit
and vegetable earth has been broken through, as in the
case of the drift which arose from the upturning of an oak
mentioned on a former page. When the valley of the Euphrates
was regularly irrigated and cultivated, the underlying
sands were bound by moisture, alluvial slime, and vegetation;
but now, that all improvement is neglected, and the surface, no
longer watered, has become parched, powdery, and naked, a
mere accidental fissure in the superficial stratum may soon be
enlarged to a wide opening, that will let loose sand enough to
overwhelm a province.</p>


<h4><i>The Landes of Gascony.</i></h4>

<p>The most remarkable sand plain of France lies at the southwestern
extremity of the empire, and is generally known as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
the Landes, or heaths, of Gascony. Clav&eacute; thus describes it:
"Composed of pure sand, resting on an impermeable stratum
called <i>alios</i>, the soil of the Landes was, for centuries, considered
incapable of cultivation. Parched in summer, drowned
in winter, it produced only ferns, rushes, and heath, and
scarcely furnished pasturage for a few half-starved flocks. To
crown its miseries, this plain was continually threatened by the
encroachments of the dunes. Vast ridges of sand, thrown up
by the waves, for a distance of more than fifty leagues along
the coast, and continually renewed, were driven inland by the
west wind, and, as they rolled over the plain, they buried the
soil and the hamlets, overcame all resistance, and advanced
with fearful regularity. The whole province seemed devoted
to certain destruction, when Br&eacute;montier invented his method
of fixing the dunes by plantations of the maritime pine."<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p><a name="Page_512_2" id="Page_512_2"></a>Although the Landes had been almost abandoned for ages,
they show numerous traces of ancient cultivation and prosperity,
and it is principally by means of the encroachments of the
sands that they have become reduced to their present desolate
condition. The destruction of the coast towns and harbors,
which furnished markets for the products of the plains, the damming
up of the rivers, and the obstruction of the smaller channels
of natural drainage by the advance of the dunes, were no
doubt very influential causes; and if we add the drifting of
the sea sand over the soil, we have at least a partial explanation
of the decayed agriculture and diminished population of this
great waste. When the dunes were once arrested, and the
soil to the east of them was felt to be secure against invasion
by them, experiments, in the way of agricultural improvement,
by drainage and plantation, were commenced, and they have
been attended with such signal success, that the complete recovery
of one of the dreariest and most extensive wastes in
Europe may be considered as both a probable and a near
event.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>The Belgian Campine.</i></h4>

<p>In the northern part of Belgium, and extending across the
confines of Holland, is another very similar heath plain, called
the Campine. This is a vast sand flat, interspersed with
marshes and inland dunes, and, until recently, considered
wholly incapable of cultivation. Enormous sums have been
expended in reclaiming it by draining and other familiar
agricultural processes, but without results at all proportional
to the capital invested. In 1849, the unimproved portion of
the Campine was estimated at little less than three hundred
and fifty thousand acres. The example of France has prompted
experiments in the planting of trees, especially the maritime
pine, upon this barren waste, and the results have been such
as to show that its sands may both be fixed and made productive,
not only without loss, but with positive pecuniary advantage.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>


<h4><i>Sands and Steppes of Eastern Europe.</i></h4>

<p>There are still unsubdued sand wastes in many parts of interior
Europe not familiarly known to tourists or even geographers.
"Olkuez and Schiewier in Poland," says Naumann,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
"lie in true sand deserts, and a boundless plain of sand stretches
around Ozenstockau, on which there grows neither tree nor
shrub. In heavy winds, this plain resembles a rolling sea, and
the sand hills rise and disappear like the waves of the ocean.
The heaps of waste from the Olkuez mines are covered with
sand to the depth of four fathoms."<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> No attempts have yet
been made to subdue the sands of Poland, but when peace and
prosperity shall be restored to that unhappy country, there is
no reasonable doubt that the measures, which have proved so
successful on similar formations in Germany, may be employed
with advantage in the Polish deserts.</p>

<p>There are sand drifts in parts of the steppes of Russia, but
in general the soil of those vast plains is of a different, though
very varied, composition, and is covered with vegetation. The
steppes, however, have many points of analogy with the sand
plains of Northern Germany, and if they are ever fitted for
civilized occupation, it must be by the same means, that is, by
planting forests. It is disputed whether the steppes were ever
wooded. They were certainly bare of forest growth at a very
remote period; for Herodotus describes the country of the
Scythians between the Ister and the Tanais as woodless, with
the exception of the small province of Xyl&aelig;a between the
Dnieper and the Gulf of Perekop. They are known to have
been occupied by a large nomade and pastoral population down
to the sixteenth century, though these tribes are now much reduced
in numbers. The habits of such races are scarcely less
destructive to the forest than those of civilized life. Pastoral
tribes do not employ much wood for fuel or for construction,
but they carelessly or recklessly burn down the forests, and
their cattle effectually check the growth of young trees wherever
their range extends.</p>

<p>At present, the furious winds which sweep over the plains,
the droughts of summer, and the rights and abuses of pasturage,
constitute very formidable obstacles to the employment of
measures which have been attended with so valuable results on
the sand wastes of France and Germany. The Russian Gov<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>ernment
has, however, attempted the wooding of the steppes, and
there are thriving plantations in the neighborhood of Odessa,
where the soil is of a particularly loose and sandy character.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>
The trees best suited to this locality, and, as there is good reason
to suppose, to sand plains in general, is the <i>Ailanthus
glandulosa</i>, or Japan varnish tree.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> The remarkable success
which has crowned the experiments with the ailanthus at
Odessa, will, no doubt, stimulate to similar trials elsewhere,
and it seems not improbable that the arundo and the maritime
pine, which have fixed so many thousand acres of drifting
sands in Western Europe, will be, partially at least, superseded
by the tamarisk and the varnish tree.</p>


<h4><i>Advantages of Reclaiming the Sands.</i></h4>

<p>If we consider the quantity of waste land which has been
made productive by the planting of the sand hills and plains,
and the extent of fertile soil, the number of villages and other
human improvements, and the value of the harbors, which the
same process has saved from being buried under the rolling
dunes, and at last swallowed up forever by the invasions of the
sea, we shall be inclined to rank Br&eacute;montier and Reventlov
among the greatest benefactors of their race. With the excep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>tion
of the dikes of the Netherlands, their labors are the first
deliberate and direct attempts of man to make himself, on a
great scale, a geographical power, to restore natural balances
which earlier generations had disturbed, and to atone, by acts
guided by foreseeing and settled purpose, for the waste which
thoughtless improvidence had created.</p>


<h4><i>Government Works.</i></h4>

<p>There is an important political difference between these latter
works and the diking system of the Netherlandish and
German coasts. The dikes originally were, and in modern
times very generally have been, private enterprises, undertaken
with no other aim than to add a certain quantity of cultivable
soil to the former possessions of their proprietor, or sometimes
of the state. In short, with few exceptions, they have been
merely a pecuniary investment, a mode of acquiring land not
economically different from purchase. The planting of the
dunes, on the contrary, has always been a public work, executed,
not with the expectation of reaping a regular direct percentage
of income from the expenditure, but dictated by higher views
of state economy&mdash;by the same governmental principles, in
fact, which animate all commonwealths in repelling invasion
by hostile armies, or in repairing the damages that invading
forces may have inflicted on the general interests of the people.
The restoration of the forests in the southern part of France,
as now conducted by the Government of that empire, is a
measure of the same elevated character as the fixing of the
dunes. In former ages, forests were formed or protected simply
for the sake of the shelter they afforded to game, or for
the timber they yielded; but the recent legislation of France,
and of some other Continental countries, on this subject, looks
to more distant as well as nobler ends, and these are among
the public acts which most strongly encourage the hope that
the rulers of Christendom are coming better to understand the
true duties and interests of civilized government.</p>

<h4><i>Cutting of Marine Isthmuses.</i></h4>

<p>Besides the great enterprises of physical transformation of
which I have already spoken, other works of internal improvement
or change have been projected in ancient and modern
times, the execution of which would produce considerable, and,
in some cases, extremely important, revolutions in the face of
the earth. Some of the schemes to which I refer are evidently
chimerical; others are difficult, indeed, but cannot be said to
be impracticable, though discouraged by the apprehension of
disastrous consequences from the disturbance of existing natural
or artificial arrangements; and there are still others, the
accomplishment of which is ultimately certain, though for the
present forbidden by economical considerations.</p>

<p>When we consider the number of narrow necks or isthmuses
which separate gulfs and bays of the sea from each other, or
from the main ocean, and take into account the time and cost,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
and risks of navigation which would be saved by executing
channels to connect such waters, and thus avoiding the necessity
of doubling long capes and promontories, or even continents,
it seems strange that more of the enterprise and money
which have been so lavishly expended in forming artificial
rivers for internal navigation should not have been bestowed
upon the construction of maritime canals. Many such have
been projected in early and in recent ages, and some trifling
cuts between marine waters have been actually made, but no
work of this sort, possessing real geographical or even commercial
importance, has yet been effected.</p>

<p>These enterprises are attended with difficulties and open to
objections, which are not, at first sight, obvious. Nature
guards well the chains by which she connects promontories
with mainlands, and binds continents together. Isthmuses are
usually composed of adamantine rock or of shifting sands&mdash;the
latter being much the more refractory material to deal
with. In all such works there is a necessity for deep excavation
below low-water mark&mdash;always a matter of great difficulty;
the dimensions of channels for sea-going ships must be much
greater than those of canals of inland navigation; the height
of the masts or smoke pipes of that class of vessels would
often render bridging impossible, and thus a ship canal might
obstruct a communication more important than that which it
was intended to promote; the securing of the entrances of
marine canals and the construction of ports at their termini
would in general be difficult and expensive, and the harbors
and the channel which connected them would be extremely
liable to fill up by deposits washed in from sea and shore.
Besides all this, there is, in many cases, an alarming uncertainty
as to the effects of joining together waters which nature
has put asunder. A new channel may deflect strong currents
from safe courses, and thus occasion destructive erosion of shores
otherwise secure, or promote the transportation of sand or slime
to block up important harbors, or it may furnish a powerful
enemy with dangerous facilities for hostile operations along the
coast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span></p>

<p>Nature sometimes mocks the cunning and the power of man
by spontaneously performing, for his benefit, works which he
shrinks from undertaking, and the execution of which by him
she would resist with unconquerable obstinacy. A dangerous
sand bank, that all the enginery of the world could not dredge
out in a generation, may be carried off in a night by a strong
river flood, or a current impelled by a violent wind from an
unusual quarter, and a passage scarcely navigable by fishing
boats may be thus converted into a commodious channel for
the largest ship that floats upon the ocean. In the remarkable
gulf of Liimfjord in Jutland, nature has given a singular example
of a canal which she alternately opens as a marine strait,
and, by shutting again, converts into a fresh-water lagoon.
The Liimfjord was doubtless originally an open channel from
the Atlantic to the Baltic between two islands, but the sand
washed up by the sea blocked up the western entrance, and
built a wall of dunes to close it more firmly. This natural
dike, as we have seen, has been more than once broken through,
and it is perhaps in the power of man, either permanently to
maintain the barrier, or to remove it and keep a navigable
channel constantly open. If the Liimfjord becomes an open
strait, the washing of sea sand through it would perhaps block
up some of the belts and small channels now important for the
navigation of the Baltic, and the direct introduction of a tidal
current might produce very perceptible effects on the hydrography
of the Cattegat.</p>


<h4><i>The Suez Canal.</i></h4>

<p>If the Suez Canal&mdash;the greatest and most truly cosmopolite
physical improvement ever undertaken by man&mdash;shall prove
successful, it will considerably affect the basins of the Mediterranean
and of the Red Sea, though in a different manner, and
probably in a less degree than the diversion of the current of the
Nile from the one to the other&mdash;to which I shall presently refer&mdash;would
do. It is, indeed, conceivable, that if a free channel
be once cut from sea to sea, the coincidence of a high tide
and a heavy south wind might produce a hydraulic force<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
that would convert the narrow canal into an open strait. In
such a case, it is impossible to estimate, or even to foresee, the
consequences which might result from the unobstructed mingling
of the flowing and ebbing currents of the Red Sea with
the almost tideless waters of the Mediterranean. There can be
no doubt, however, that they would be of a most important
character as respects the simply geographical features and the
organic life of both. But the shallowness of the two seas at
the termini of the canal, the action of the tides of the one and
the currents of the other, and the nature of the intervening isthmus,
render the occurrence of such a cataclysm in the highest
degree improbable. The obstruction of the canal by sea sand
at both ends is a danger far more difficult to guard against and
avert, than an irruption of the waters of either sea.</p>

<p>There is, then, no reason to expect any change of coast
lines or of natural navigable channels as a direct consequence
of the opening of the Suez Canal, but it will, no doubt, produce
very interesting revolutions in the animal and vegetable population
of both basins. The Mediterranean, with some local
exceptions&mdash;such as the bays of Calabria, and the coast of
Sicily so picturesquely described by Quatrefages<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>&mdash;is comparatively
poor in marine vegetation, and in shell as well as
in fin fish. The scarcity of fish in some of its gulfs is proverbial,
and you may scrutinize long stretches of beach on its
northern shores, after every south wind for a whole winter,
without finding a dozen shells to reward your search. But no
one who has not looked down into tropical or subtropical seas
can conceive the amazing wealth of the Red Sea in organic
life. Its bottom is carpeted or paved with marine plants, with
zoophytes and with shells, while its waters are teeming with
infinitely varied forms of moving life. Most of its vegetables
and its animals, no doubt, are confined by the laws of their organization
to warmer temperatures than that of the Mediterranean,
but among them there must be many, whose habitat
is of a wider range, many whose powers of accommodation
would enable them to acclimate themselves in a colder sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span></p>

<p>We may suppose the less numerous aquatic fauna and flora
of the Mediterranean to be equally capable of climatic adaptation,
and hence, when the canal shall be opened, there will be
an interchange of the organic population not already common
to both seas. Destructive species, thus newly introduced, may
diminish the numbers of their proper prey in either basin, and,
on the other hand, the increased supply of appropriate food
may greatly multiply the abundance of others, and at the same
time add important contributions to the aliment of man in the
countries bordering on the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>A collateral feature of this great project deserves notice as
possessing no inconsiderable geographical importance. I refer
to the conduit or conduits constructed from the Nile to the
isthmus, primarily to supply fresh water to the laborers on the
great canal, and ultimately to serve as aqueducts for the city
of Suez, and for the irrigation and reclamation of a large extent
of desert soil. In the flourishing days of the Egyptian
empire, the waters of the Nile were carried over important
districts east of the river. In later ages, most of this territory
relapsed into a desert, from the decay of the canals which
once fertilized it. There is no difficulty in restoring the ancient
channels, or in constructing new, and thus watering not only
all the soil that the wisdom of the Pharaohs had improved, but
much additional land. Hundreds of square miles of arid sand
waste would thus be converted into fields of perennial verdure,
and the geography of Lower Egypt would be thereby sensibly
changed. If the canal succeeds, considerable towns will grow
up at once at both ends of the channel, and at intermediate
points, all depending on the maintenance of aqueducts from
the Nile, both for water and for the irrigation of the neighboring
fields which are to supply them with bread. Important
interests will thus be created, which will secure the permanence
of the hydraulic works and of the geographical changes produced
by them, and Suez, or Port Said, or the city at Lake
Timsah, may become the capital of the government which has
been so long established at Cairo.</p>

<h4><i>Canal across the Isthmus of Darien.</i></h4>

<p>The most colossal project of canalization ever suggested,
whether we consider the physical difficulties of its execution,
the magnitude and importance of the waters proposed to be
united, or the distance which would be saved in navigation, is
that of a channel between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific,
across the Isthmus of Darien. I do not now speak of a lock
canal, by way of the Lake of Nicaragua or any other route&mdash;for
such a work would not differ essentially from other canals,
and would scarcely possess a geographical character&mdash;but of an
open cut between the two seas. It has been by no means shown
that the construction of such a channel is possible, and, if it
were opened, it is highly probable that sand bars would accumulate
at both entrances, so as to obstruct any powerful current
through it. But if we suppose the work to be actually
accomplished, there would be, in the first place, such a mixture
of the animal and vegetable life of the two great oceans as I
have stated to be likely to result from the opening of the Suez
Canal between two much smaller basins. In the next place,
if the channel were not obstructed by sand bars, it might sooner
or later be greatly widened and deepened by the mechanical
action of the current through it, and consequences, not inferior
in magnitude to any physical revolution which has taken place
since man appeared upon the earth, might result from it.</p>

<p>What those consequences would be is in a great degree
matter of pure conjecture, and there is much room for the exercise
of the imagination on the subject; but, as more than one
geographer has suggested, there is one possible result which
throws all other conceivable effects of such a work quite into the
shade. I refer to changes in the course of the two great oceanic
rivers, the Gulf Stream and the corresponding current on the
Pacific side of the isthmus. The warm waters which the Gulf
Stream transports to high latitudes and then spreads out, like
an expanded hand, along the eastern shores of the Atlantic,
give out, as they cool, heat enough to raise the mean temperature
of Western Europe several degrees. In fact, the Gulf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
Stream is the principal cause of the superiority of the climate
of Western Europe over those of Eastern America and Eastern
Asia in the corresponding latitudes. All the meteorological
conditions of the former region are in a great measure regulated
by it, and hence it is the grandest and most beneficent of all
purely geographical phenomena. We do not yet know enough
of the laws which govern the movements of this mighty flood
of warmth and life to be able to say whether its current would
be perceptibly affected by the severance of the Isthmus of
Darien; but as it enters and sweeps round the Gulf of Mexico,
it is possible that the removal of the resistance of the land
which forms the western shore of that sea, might allow the
stream to maintain its original westward direction, and join
itself to the tropical current of the Pacific.</p>

<p>The effect of such a change would be an immediate depression
of the mean temperature of Western Europe to the level
of that of Eastern America, and perhaps the climate of the
former continent might become as excessive as that of the
latter, or even a new "ice period" be occasioned by the withdrawal
of so important a source of warmth from the northern
zones. Hence would result the extinction of vast multitudes
of land and sea plants and animals, and a total revolution in
the domestic and rural economy of human life in all those
countries from which the New World has received its civilized
population. Other scarcely less startling consequences may be
imagined as possible; but the whole speculation is too dreary,
distant, and improbable to deserve to be long indulged in.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<h4><i>Canals to the Dead Sea.</i></h4>

<p>The project of Captain Allen for opening a new route to
India by cuts between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea,
and between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea, presents many
interesting considerations.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> The hypsometrical observations
of Bertou, Roth, and others, render it highly probable, if
not certain, that the watershed in the Wadi-el-Araba between
the Dead Sea and the Red Sea is not less than three hundred
feet above the mean level of the latter, and if this is so, the
execution of a canal from the one sea to the other is quite out
of the question. But the summit level between the Mediterranean
and the Jordan, near Jezreel, is believed to be little, if
at all, more than one hundred feet above the sea, and the distance
is so short that the cutting of a channel through the
dividing ridge would probably be found by no means an impracticable
undertaking. Although, therefore, we have no
reason to believe it possible to open a navigable channel to the
east by way of the Dead Sea, there is not much doubt that the
basin of the latter might be made accessible from the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The level of the Dead Sea lies 1,316.7 feet below that of
the ocean. It is bounded east and west by mountain ridges,
rising to the height of from 2,000 to 4,000 feet above the
ocean. From its southern end, a depression called the Wadi-el-Araba
extends to the Gulf of Akaba, the eastern arm of the
Red Sea. The Jordan empties into its northern extremity,
after having passed through the Lake of Tiberias at an elevation
of 663.4 feet above the Dead Sea, or 653.3 below the Mediterranean,
and drains a considerable valley north of the lake,
as well as the plain of Jericho, which lies between the lake
and the sea. If the waters of the Mediterranean were admitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
freely into the basin of the Dead Sea, they would raise its surface
to the general level of the ocean, and consequently flood
all the dry land below that level within the basin.</p>

<p>I do not know that accurate levels have been taken in the
valley of the Jordan above the Lake of Tiberias, and our information
is very vague as to the hypsometry of the northern
part of the Wadi-el-Araba. As little do we know where a
contour line, carried around the basin at the level of the Mediterranean,
would strike its eastern and western borders. We
cannot, therefore, accurately compute the extent of now dry
land which would be covered by the admission of the waters
of the Mediterranean, or the area of the inland sea which
would be thus created. Its length, however, would certainly
exceed one hundred and fifty miles, and its mean breadth, including
its gulfs and bays, could scarcely be less than fifteen,
perhaps even twenty. It would cover very little ground now
occupied by civilized or even uncivilized man, though some of
the soil which would be submerged&mdash;for instance, that watered
by the Fountain of Elisha and other neighboring sources&mdash;is of
great fertility, and, under a wiser government and better civil
institutions, might rise to importance, because, from its depression,
it possesses a very warm climate, and might supply Southeastern
Europe with tropical products more readily than they
can be obtained from any other source. Such a canal and sea
would be of no present commercial importance, because they
would give access to no new markets or sources of supply; but
when the fertile valleys and the deserted plains east of the
Jordan shall be reclaimed to agriculture and civilization, these
waters would furnish a channel of communication which might
become the medium of a very extensive trade.</p>

<p>Whatever might be the economical results of the opening
and filling of the Dead Sea basin, the creation of a new evaporable
area, adding not less than 2,000 or perhaps 3,000 square
miles to the present fluid surface of Syria, could not fail to
produce important meteorological effects. The climate of
Syria would be tempered, its precipitation and its fertility increased,
the courses of its winds and the electrical condition
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>of its atmosphere modified. The present organic life of the
valley would be extinguished, and many tribes of plants
and animals would emigrate from the Mediterranean to the
new home which human art had prepared for them. It is
possible, too, that the addition of 1,300 feet, or forty atmospheres,
of hydrostatic pressure upon the bottom of the basin
might disturb the equilibrium between the internal and the
external forces of the crust of the earth at this point of abnormal
configuration, and thus produce geological convulsions the
intensity of which cannot be even conjectured.</p>


<h4><i>Maritime Canals in Greece.</i></h4>

<p>A maritime canal executed and another projected in ancient
times, the latter of which is again beginning to excite
attention, deserve some notice, though their importance is of a
commercial rather than a geographical character. The first
of these is the cut made by Xerxes through the rock which
connects the promontory of Mount Athos with the mainland;
the other, a navigable canal through the Isthmus of Corinth.
In spite of the testimony of Herodotus and Thucydides, the
Romans classed the canal of Xerxes among the fables of "mendacious
Greece," and yet traces of it are perfectly distinct at
the present day through its whole extent, except at a single
point where, after it had become so choked as to be no longer
navigable, it was probably filled up to facilitate communication
by land between the promontory and the country in the
rear of it.</p>

<p>If the fancy kingdom of Greece shall ever become a sober
reality, escape from its tutelage and acquire such a moral as
well as political status that its own capitalists&mdash;who now prefer
to establish themselves and employ their funds anywhere
else rather than in their native land&mdash;have any confidence in
the permanency of its institutions, a navigable channel will no
doubt be opened between the gulfs of Lepanto and &AElig;gina.
The annexation of the Ionian Islands to Greece will make such
a work almost a political necessity, and it would not only fur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>nish
valuable facilities for domestic intercourse, but become an
important channel of communication between the Levant and
the countries bordering on the Adriatic, or conducting their
trade through that sea.</p>

<p>As I have said, the importance of this latter canal and of a
navigable channel between Mount Athos and the continent
would be chiefly commercial, but both of them would be conspicuous
instances of the control of man over nature in a field
where he has thus far done little to interfere with her spontaneous
arrangements. If they were constructed upon such a
scale as to admit of the free passage of the water through
them, in either direction, as the prevailing winds should impel
it, they would exercise a certain influence on the coast currents,
which are important as hydrographical elements, and
also as producing abrasion of the coast and a drift at the bottom
of seas, and hence would be entitled to a higher rank than
simply as artificial means of transit.</p>


<h4><i>Canal of Saros.</i></h4>

<p>It has been thought practicable to cut a canal across the
peninsula of Gallipoli from the outlet of the Sea of Marmora
into the Gulf of Saros. It may be doubted whether the mechanical
difficulties of such a work would not be found insuperable;
but when Constantinople shall recover the important political
and commercial rank which naturally belongs to her, the execution
of such a canal will be recommended by strong reasons
of military expediency, as well as by the interests of trade.
An open channel across the peninsula would divert a portion
of the water which now flows through the Dardanelles, diminish
the rapidity of that powerful current, and thus in part remove
the difficulties which obstruct the navigation of the
strait. It would considerably abridge the distance by water
between Constantinople and the northern coast of the &AElig;gean,
and it would have the important advantage of obliging an
enemy to maintain two blockading fleets instead of one.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Cape Cod Canal.</i></h4>

<p>The opening of a navigable cut through the narrow neck
which separates the southern part of Cape Cod Bay in Massachusetts
from the Atlantic, was long ago suggested, and there
are few coast improvements on the Atlantic shores of the United
States which are recommended by higher considerations of
utility. It would save the most important coasting trade of
the United States the long and dangerous navigation around
Cape Cod, afford a new and safer entrance to Boston harbor
for vessels from Southern ports, secure a choice of passages,
thus permitting arrivals upon the coast and departures from it
at periods when wind and weather might otherwise prevent
them, and furnish a most valuable internal communication in
case of coast blockade by a foreign power. The difficulties of
the undertaking are no doubt formidable, but the expense of
maintenance and the uncertainty of the effects of currents setting
through the new strait are still more serious objections.</p>


<h4><i>Diversion of the Nile.</i></h4>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable project of great physical
change, proposed or threatened in earlier ages, is that of the
diversion of the Nile from its natural channel, and the turning
of its current into either the Libyan desert or the Red Sea.
The Ethiopian or Abyssinian princes more than once menaced
the Memlouk sultans with the execution of this alarming project,
and the fear of so serious an evil is said to have induced
the Moslems to conciliate the Abyssinian kings by large presents,
and by some concessions to the oppressed Christians of
Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> Indeed, Arabic historians affirm that in the tenth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
century the Ethiopians dammed the river, and, for a whole
year, cut off its waters from Egypt. The probable explanation
of this story is to be found in a season of extreme drought,
such as have sometimes occurred in the valley of the Nile.
About the beginning of the sixteenth century, Albuquerque
the "Terrible" revived the scheme of turning the Nile into
the Red Sea, with the hope of destroying the transit trade
through Egypt by way of Kesseir. In 1525 the King of Portugal
was requested by the Emperor of Abyssinia to send him
engineers for that purpose; a successor of that prince threatened
to attempt the project about the year 1700, and even as
late as the French occupation of Egypt, the possibility of
driving out the intruder by this means was suggested in
England.</p>

<p>It cannot be positively affirmed that the diversion of the
waters of the Nile to the Red Sea is impossible. In the chain
of mountains which separates the two valleys, Brown found a
deep depression or wadi, extending from the one to the other,
at no great elevation above the bed of the river. The Libyan
desert is so much higher than the Nile below the junction of
the two principal branches at Khartum, that there is no reason
to believe a new channel for their united waters could be
found in that direction; but the Bahr-el-Abiad flows through,
if it does not rise in, a great table land, and some of its tributaries
are supposed to communicate in the rainy season with
branches of great rivers flowing in quite another direction.
Hence it is probable that a portion at least of the waters of
this great arm of the Nile&mdash;and perhaps a quantity the abstraction
of which would be sensibly felt in Egypt&mdash;might be
sent to the Atlantic by the Niger, lost in the inland lakes of
Central Africa, or employed to fertilize the Libyan sand
wastes.</p>

<p>Admitting the possibility of turning the whole river into
the Red Sea, let us consider the probable effect of the change.
First and most obvious is the total destruction of the fertility
of Middle and Lower Egypt, the conversion of that part of the
valley into a desert, and the extinction of its imperfect civiliza<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>tion,
if not the absolute extirpation of its inhabitants. This is
the calamity threatened by the Abyssinian princes and the ferocious
Portuguese warrior, and feared by the sultans of Egypt.
Beyond these immediate and palpable consequences neither
party then looked; but a far wider geographical area, and far
more extensive and various human interests, would be affected
by the measure. The spread of the Nile during the annual inundation
covers, for many weeks, several thousand square
miles with water, and at other seasons of the year pervades
the same and even a larger area with moisture by infiltration.
The abstraction of so large an evaporable surface from the
southern shores of the Mediterranean could not but produce
important effects on many meteorological phenomena, and the
humidity, the temperature, the electrical condition and the atmospheric
currents of Northeastern Africa might be modified
to a degree that would sensibly affect the climate of Europe.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean, deprived of the contributions of the
Nile, would require a larger supply, and of course a stronger
current, of water from the Atlantic through the Straits of Gibraltar;
the proportion of salt it contains would be increased,
and the animal life of at least its southern borders would be
consequently modified; the current which winds along its
southern, eastern, and northeastern shores would be diminished
in force and volume, if not destroyed altogether, and its
basin and its harbors would be shoaled by no new deposits
from the highlands of inner Africa.</p>

<p>In the much smaller Red Sea, more immediately perceptible,
if not greater, effects, would be produced. The deposits
of slime would reduce its depth, and perhaps, in the course of
ages, divide it into an inland and an open sea; its waters
would be more or less freshened, and its immensely rich marine
fauna and flora changed in character and proportion, and,
near the mouth of the river, perhaps even destroyed altogether;
its navigable channels would be altered in position and often
quite obstructed; the flow of its tides would be modified by
the new geographical conditions; the sediment of the river
would form new coast lines and lowlands, which would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
covered with vegetation, and probably thereby produce sensible
climatic changes.</p>


<h4><i>Changes in the Caspian.</i></h4>

<p>The Russian Government has contemplated the establishment
of a nearly direct water communication between the Caspian
Sea and the Sea of Azoff, partly by natural and partly by
artificial channels, and there are now navigable canals between
the Don and the Volga; but these works, though not wanting
in commercial and political interest, do not possess any geographical
importance. It is, however, very possible to produce
appreciable geographical changes in the basin of the Caspian
by the diversion of the great rivers which flow from Central
Russia. The surface of the Caspian is eighty-three feet
below the level of the Sea of Azoff, and its depression has been
explained upon the hypothesis that the evaporation exceeds
the supply derived, directly and indirectly, from precipitation,
though able physicists now maintain that the sinking of this
sea is due to a subsidence of its bottom from geological causes.
At Tsaritsin, the Don, which empties into the Sea of Azoff,
and the Volga, which pours into the Caspian, approach each
other within ten miles. Near this point, by means of open or
subterranean canals, the Don might be turned into the Volga,
or the Volga into the Don. If we suppose the whole or a
large proportion of the waters of the Don to be thus diverted
from their natural outlet and sent down to the Caspian, the
equilibrium between the evaporation from that sea and its
supply of water might be restored, or its level even raised
above its ancient limits. If the Volga were turned into the
Sea of Azoff, the Caspian would be reduced in dimensions
until the balance between loss and gain should be re&euml;stablished,
and it would occupy a much smaller area than at present.
Such changes in the proportion of solid and fluid surface
would have some climatic effects in the territory which drains
into the Caspian, and on the other hand, the introduction of a
greater quantity of fresh water into the Sea of Azoff would
render that gulf less saline, affect the character and numbers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
of its fish, and perhaps be not wholly without sensible influence
on the water of the Black Sea.</p>


<h4><i>Improvements in North American Hydrography.</i></h4>

<p>We are not yet well enough acquainted with the geography
of Central Africa, or of the interior of South America, to conjecture
what hydrographical revolutions might there be
wrought; but from the fact that many important rivers in
both continents drain extensive table lands, of very moderate
inclination, there is reason to suppose that important changes
in the course of rivers might be accomplished. Our knowledge
of the drainage of North America is much more complete,
and it is certain that there are numerous points where
the courses of great rivers, or the discharge of considerable
lakes, might be completely diverted, or at least partially directed
into different channels.</p>

<p>The surface of Lake Erie is 565 feet above that of the Hudson
at Albany, and it is so near the level of the great plain
lying east of it, that it was found practicable to supply the
western section of the canal, which unites it with the Hudson,
with water from the lake, or rather from the Niagara which
flows out of it. Hence a channel might be constructed, which
would draw off into the valley of the Genesee any desirable
proportion of the water naturally discharged by the Niagara.
The greatest depth of water yet sounded in Lake Erie is but
two hundred and seventy feet, the mean depth one hundred
and twenty. Open canals parallel with the Niagara, or directly
toward the Genesee, might be executed upon a scale
which would exercise an important influence on the drainage
of the lake, if there were any adequate motive for such an undertaking.
Still easier would it be to create additional outlets
for the waters of Lake Superior at the Saut St. Mary&mdash;where
the river which drains the lake descends twenty-two feet in a
single mile&mdash;and thus produce incalculable effects, both upon
that lake and upon the great chain of inland waters which
communicate with it.</p>

<p>The summit level between Lake Michigan and the Des<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
Plaines, a tributary of the Mississippi, is only twenty-seven
feet above the lake, and the intervening distance is but a very
few miles. It has often been proposed to cut an open channel
across this ridge, and there is no doubt of the practicability of
the project. Were this accomplished, although such a cut
would not, of itself, form a navigable canal, a part of the
waters of Lake Michigan would be contributed to the Gulf of
Mexico, instead of to that of St. Lawrence, and the flow might
be so regulated as to keep the Illinois and the Mississippi at
flood at all seasons of the year. The increase in the volume
of these rivers would augment their velocity and their transporting
power, and consequently, the erosion of their banks
and the deposit of slime in the Gulf of Mexico, while the introduction
of a larger body of cold water into the beds of these
rivers would very probably produce a considerable effect on
the animal life that peoples them. The diversion of water
from the common basin of the great lakes through a new channel,
in a direction opposite to their natural discharge, would
not be absolutely without influence on the St. Lawrence,
though probably the effect would be too small to be in any
way perceptible.</p>


<h4><i>Diversion of the Rhine.</i></h4>

<p>The interference of physical improvements with vested
rights and ancient arrangements, is a more formidable obstacle
in old countries than in new, to enterprises involving anything
approaching to a geographical revolution. Hence such projects
meet with stronger opposition in Europe than in America,
and the number of probable changes in the face of nature
in the former continent is proportionally less. I have noticed
some important hydraulic improvements as already executed
or in progress in Europe, and I may refer to some others as
contemplated or suggested. One of these is the diversion of
the Rhine from its present channel below Ragatz, by a cut
through the narrow ridge near Sargans, and the consequent
turning of its current into the Lake of Wallenstadt. This
would be an extremely easy undertaking, for the ridge is but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
twenty feet above the level of the Rhine, and hardly two hundred
yards wide. There is no present adequate motive for
this diversion, but it is easy to suppose that it may become advisable
within no long period. The navigation of the Lake
of Constance is rapidly increasing in importance, and the
shoaling of the eastern end of that lake by the deposits of the
Rhine may require a remedy which can be found by no other
so ready means as the discharge of that river into the Lake of
Wallenstadt. The navigation of this latter lake is not important,
nor is it ever likely to become so, because the rocky and
precipitous character of its shores renders their cultivation
impossible. It is of great depth, and its basin is capacious
enough to receive and retain all the sediment which the Rhine
would carry into it for thousands of years.</p>


<h4><i>Draining of the Zuiderzee.</i></h4>

<p>I have referred to the draining of the Lake of Haarlem as
an operation of great geographical as well as economical and
mechanical interest. A much more gigantic project, of a similar
character, is now engaging the attention of the Netherlandish
engineers. It is proposed to drain the great salt-water
basin called the Zuiderzee. This inland sea covers an area of
not less than two thousand square miles, or about one million
three hundred thousand acres. The seaward half, or that portion
lying northwest of a line drawn from Enkhuizen to Stavoren,
is believed to have been converted from a marsh to an
open bay since the fifth century after Christ, and this change
is ascribed, partly if not wholly, to the interference of man
with the order of nature. The Zuiderzee communicates with
the sea by at least six considerable channels, separated from
each other by low islands, and the tide rises within the basin
to the height of three feet. To drain the Zuiderzee, these
channels must first be closed and the passage of the tidal flood
through them cut off. If this be done, the coast currents will
be restored approximately to the lines they followed fourteen
or fifteen centuries ago, and there can be little doubt that an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
appreciable effect will thus be produced upon all the tidal
phenomena of that coast, and, of course, upon the maritime
geography of Holland.</p>

<p>A ring dike and canal must then be constructed around
the landward side of the basin, to exclude and carry off the
fresh-water streams which now empty into it. One of these,
the Ijssel, a considerable river, has a course of eighty miles,
and is, in fact, one of the outlets of the Rhine, though augmented
by the waters of several independent tributaries.
These preparations being made, and perhaps transverse dikes
erected at convenient points for dividing the gulf into smaller
portions, the water must be pumped out by machinery, in substantially
the same way as in the case of the Lake of Haarlem.
No safe calculations can be made as to the expenditure of time
and money required for the execution of this stupendous enterprise,
but I believe its practicability is not denied by competent
judges, though doubts are entertained as to its financial
expediency. The geographical results of this improvement
would be analogous to those of the draining of the Lake of
Haarlem, but many times multiplied in extent, and its meteorological
effects, though perhaps not perceptible on the coast,
could hardly fail to be appreciable in the interior of Holland.</p>


<h4><i>Waters of the Karst.</i></h4>

<p>The singular structure of the Karst, the great limestone
plateau lying to the north of Trieste, has suggested some engineering
operations which might be attended with sensible
effects upon the geography of the province. I have described
this table land as, though now bare of forests, and almost of
vegetation, having once been covered with woods, and as being
completely honeycombed by caves through which the drainage
of that region is conducted. Schmidl has spent years in
studying the subterranean geography and hydrography of this
singular district, and his discoveries, and those of earlier cave-hunters,
have led to various proposals of physical improvement
of a novel character. Many of the underground water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
courses of the Karst are without visible outlet, and, in some
instances at least, they, no doubt, send their waters, by deep
channels, to the Adriatic.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> The city of Trieste is very insufficiently
provided with fresh water. It has been thought practicable
to supply this want by tunnelling through the wall of
the plateau, which rises abruptly in the rear of the town, until
some subterranean stream is encountered, the current of which
can be conducted to the city. More visionary projectors have
gone further, and imagined that advantage might be taken of
the natural tunnels under the Karst for the passage of roads,
railways, and even navigable canals. But however chimerical
these latter schemes may seem, there is every reason to believe
that art might avail itself of these galleries for improving the
imperfect drainage of the champaign country bounded by the
Karst, and that stopping or opening the natural channels
might very much modify the hydrography of an extensive
region.</p>


<h4><i>Subterranean Waters of Greece.</i></h4>

<p>There are parts of continental Greece which resemble the
Karst and the adjacent plains in being provided with a natural
subterranean drainage. The superfluous waters run off into
limestone caves called <i>catavothra</i> (&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#972;&#952;&#961;&#945;). In ancient
times, the entrances to the catavothra were enlarged or partially
closed as the convenience of drainage or irrigation required,
and there is no doubt that similar measures might be
adopted at the present day with great advantage both to the
salubrity and the productiveness of the regions so drained.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Soil below Rock.</i></h4>

<p>One of the most singular changes of natural surface effected
by man is that observed by Beechey and by Barth at L&icirc;n
Tefla, and near Gebel Gen&ucirc;nes, in the district of Ben G&acirc;si, in
Northern Africa. In this region the superficial stratum originally
consisted of a thin sheet of rock covering a layer of fertile
earth. This rock has been broken up, and, when not practicable
to find use for it in fences, fortresses, or dwellings,
heaped together in high piles, and the soil, thus bared of its
stony shell, has been employed for agricultural purposes.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> If
we remember that gunpowder was unknown at the period
when these remarkable improvements were executed, and of
course that the rock could have been broken only with the
chisel and wedge, we must infer that land had at that time a
very great pecuniary value, and, of course, that the province,
though now exhausted, and almost entirely deserted by man,
had once a dense population.</p>


<h4><i>Covering Rock with Earth.</i></h4>

<p>If man has, in some cases, broken up rock to reach productive
ground beneath, he has, in many other instances, covered
bare ledges, and sometimes extensive surfaces of solid stone,
with fruitful earth, brought from no inconsiderable distance.
Not to speak of the Campo Santo at Pisa, filled, or at least
coated, with earth from the Holy Land, for quite a different
purpose, it is affirmed that the garden of the monastery of St.
Catherine at Mount Sinai is composed of Nile mud, transported
on the backs of camels from the banks of that river. Parthey
and older authors state that all the productive soil of the
Island of Malta was brought over from Sicily.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> The accuracy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
of the information may be questioned in both cases, but similar
practices, on a smaller scale, are matter of daily observation in
many parts of Southern Europe. Much of the wine of the
Moselle is derived from grapes grown on earth carried high
up the cliffs on the shoulders of men. In China, too, rock
has been artificially covered with earth to an extent which
gives such operations a real geographical importance, and the
accounts of the importation of earth at Malta, and the fertilization
of the rocks on Mount Sinai with slime from the Nile,
may be not wholly without foundation.</p>


<h4><i>Wadies of Arabia, Petr&aelig;a.</i></h4>

<p>In the latter case, indeed, river sediment might be very
useful as a manure, but it could hardly be needed as a soil;
for the growth of vegetation in the wadies of the Sinaitic Peninsula
shows that the disintegrated rock of its mountains requires
only water to stimulate it to considerable productiveness.
The wadies present, not unfrequently, narrow gorges,
which might easily be closed, and thus accumulations of earth,
and reservoirs of water to irrigate it, might be formed which
would convert many a square mile of desert into flourishing
date gardens and cornfields. Not far from Wadi Feiran, on
the most direct route to Wadi Esh-Sheikh, is a very narrow
pass called by the Arabs El Bueb (El Bab) or, The Gate,
which might be securely closed to a very considerable height,
with little labor or expense. Above this pass is a wide and
nearly level expanse, containing a hundred acres, perhaps
much more. This is filled up to a certain regular level with
deposits brought down by torrents before the Gate, or Bueb,
was broken through, and they have now worn down a channel
in the deposits to the bed of the wadi. If a dam were constructed
at the pass, and reservoirs built to retain the winter
rains, a great extent of valley might be rendered cultivable.</p>

<h4><i>Incidental Effects of Human Action.</i></h4>

<p>I have more than once alluded to the collateral and unsought
consequences of human action as being often more momentous
than the direct and desired results. There are cases
where such incidental, or, in popular speech, accidental, consequences,
though of minor importance in themselves, serve to
illustrate natural processes; others, where, by the magnitude
and character of the material traces they leave behind them,
they prove that man, in primary or in more advanced stages
of social life, must have occupied particular districts for a
longer period than has been supposed by popular chronology.
"On the coast of Jutland," says Forchhammer, "wherever a
bolt from a wreck or any other fragment of iron is deposited
in the beach sand, the particles are cemented together, and
form a very solid mass around the iron. A remarkable formation
of this sort was observed a few years ago in constructing
the sea wall of the harbor of Elsineur. This stratum, which
seldom exceeded a foot in thickness, rested upon common
beach sand, and was found at various depths, less near the
shore, greater at some distance from it. It was composed of
pebbles and sand, and contained a great quantity of pins, and
some coins of the reign of Christian IV, between the beginning
and the middle of the seventeenth century. Here and
there, a coating of metallic copper had been deposited by galvanic
action, and the presence of completely oxydized metallic
iron was often detected. An investigation undertaken by
Councillor Reinhard and myself, at the instance of the Society
of Science, made it in the highest degree probable that this
formation owed its origin to the street sweepings of the town,
which had been thrown upon the beach, and carried off and
distributed by the waves over the bottom of the harbor."<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>
These and other familiar observations of the like sort show
that a sandstone reef, of no inconsiderable magnitude, might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
originate from the stranding of a ship with a cargo of iron,<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> or
from throwing the waste of an establishment for working metals
into running water which might carry it to the sea.</p>

<p>Parthey records a singular instance of unforeseen mischief
from an interference with the arrangements of nature. A landowner
at Malta possessed a rocky plateau sloping gradually
toward the sea, and terminating in a precipice forty or fifty
feet high, through natural openings in which the sea water
flowed into a large cave under the rock. The proprietor attempted
to establish salt works on the surface, and cut shallow
pools in the rock for the evaporation of the water. In order
to fill the salt pans more readily, he sank a well down to the
cave beneath, through which he drew up water by a windlass
and buckets. The speculation proved a failure, because the
water filtered through the porous bottom of the pans, leaving
little salt behind. But this was a small evil, compared with
other destructive consequences that followed. When the sea
was driven into the cave by violent west or northwest winds,
it shot a <i>jet d'eau</i> through the well to the height of sixty feet,
the spray of which was scattered far and wide over the neighboring
gardens and blasted the crops. The well was now
closed with stones, but the next winter's storms hurled them
out again, and spread the salt spray over the grounds in the
vicinity as before. Repeated attempts were made to stop the
orifice, but at the time of Parthey's visit the sea had thrice
burst through, and it was feared that the evil was without
remedy.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p>I have mentioned the great extent of the heaps of oyster
and other shells left by the American Indians on the Atlantic
coast of the United States. Some of the Danish kitchen-middens,
which closely resemble them, are a thousand feet
long, from one hundred and fifty to two hundred wide, and
from six to ten high. These piles have an importance as geological
witnesses, independent of their bearing upon human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
history. Wherever the coast line appears, from other evidence,
to have remained unchanged in outline and elevation since
they were accumulated, they are found near the sea, and not
more than about ten feet above its level. In some cases they
are at a considerable distance from the beach, and in these instances,
so far as yet examined, there are proofs that the coast
has advanced in consequence of upheaval or of fluviatile or
marine deposit. Where they are altogether wanting, the coast
seems to have sunk or been washed away by the sea. The
constancy of these observations justifies geologists in arguing,
where other evidence is wanting, the advance of land or sea
respectively, or the elevation or depression of the former, from
the position or the absence of these heaps alone.</p>

<p>Every traveller in Italy is familiar with Monte Testaccio,
the mountain of potsherds, at Rome; but this deposit, large
as it is, shrinks into insignificance when compared with masses
of similar origin in the neighborhood of older cities. The castaway
pottery of ancient towns in Magna Gr&aelig;cia composes
strata of such extent and thickness that they have been dignified
with the appellation of the ceramic formation. The Nile,
as it slowly changes its bed, exposes in its banks masses of the
same material, so vast that the population of the world during
the whole historical period would seem to have chosen this
valley as a general deposit for its broken vessels.</p>

<p>The fertility imparted to the banks of the Nile by the water
and the slime of the inundations, is such that manures are
little employed. Hence much domestic waste, which would
elsewhere be employed to enrich the soil, is thrown out into
vacant places near the town. Hills of rubbish are thus piled
up which astonish the traveller almost as much as the solid
pyramids themselves. The heaps of ashes and other household
refuse collected on the borders and within the limits of
Cairo were so large, that the removal of them by Ibrahim
Pacha has been looked upon as one of the great works of the
age.</p>

<p>The soil near cities, the street sweepings of which are
spread upon the ground as manure, is perceptibly raised by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
them and by other effects of human industry, and in spite of
all efforts to remove the waste, the level of the ground on
which large towns stand is constantly elevated. The present
streets of Rome are twenty feet above those of the ancient
city. The Appian way between Rome and Albano, when
cleared out a few years ago, was found buried four or five feet
deep, and the fields along the road were elevated nearly or
quite as much. The floors of many churches in Italy, not
more than six or seven centuries old, are now three or four feet
below the adjacent streets, though it is proved by excavations
that they were built as many feet above them.</p>


<h4><i>Resistance to Great Natural Forces.</i></h4>

<p>I have often spoken of the greater and more subtile natural
forces, and especially of geological agencies, as powers beyond
human guidance or resistance. This is no doubt at present
true in the main, but man has shown that he is not altogether
impotent to struggle with even these mighty servants of nature,
and his unconscious as well as his deliberate action may
in some cases have increased or diminished the intensity of their
energies. It is a very ancient belief that earthquakes are more
destructive in districts where the crust of the earth is solid and
homogeneous, than where it is of a looser and more interrupted
structure. Aristotle, Pliny the elder, and Seneca believed
that not only natural ravines and caves, but quarries, wells,
and other human excavations, which break the continuity of
the terrestrial strata and facilitate the escape of elastic vapors,
have a sensible influence in diminishing the violence and preventing
the propagation of the earth waves. In all countries
subject to earthquakes this opinion is still maintained, and it
is asserted that, both in ancient and in modern times, buildings
protected by deep wells under or near them have suffered less
from earthquakes than those the architects of which have neglected
this precaution.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span></p>
<p>If the commonly received theory of the cause of earthquakes
is true&mdash;that, namely, which ascribes them to the elastic
force of gases accumulated or generated in subterranean
reservoirs&mdash;it is evident that open channels of communication
between such reservoirs and the atmosphere might serve as a
harmless discharge of gases that would otherwise acquire destructive
energy. The doubt is whether artificial excavations
can be carried deep enough to reach the laboratory where the
elastic fluids are distilled. There are, in many places, small
natural crevices through which such fluids escape, and the
source of them sometimes lies at so moderate a depth that they
pervade the superficial soil and, as it were, transpire from it,
over a considerable area. When the borer of an ordinary artesian
well strikes into a cavity in the earth, imprisoned air
often rushes out with great violence, and this has been still
more frequently observed in sinking mineral-oil wells. In
this latter case, the discharge of a vehement current of inflammable
fluid sometimes continues for hours and even longer
periods. These facts seem to render it not wholly improbable
that the popular belief of the efficacy of deep wells in mitigating
the violence of earthquakes is well founded.</p>

<p>In general, light, wooden buildings are less injured by
earthquakes than more solid structures of stone or brick, and
it is commonly supposed that the power put forth by the earth
wave is too great to be resisted by any amount of weight or
solidity of mass that man can pile up upon the surface. But
the fact that in countries subject to earthquakes many very large
and strongly constructed palaces, temples, and other monuments
have stood for centuries, comparatively uninjured, suggests
a doubt whether this opinion is sound. The earthquake
of the first of November, 1755, which was felt over a twelfth
part of the earth's surface, was probably the most violent of
which we have any clear and distinct account, and it seems to
have exerted its most destructive force at Lisbon. It has often
been noticed as a remarkable fact, that the mint, a building
of great solidity, was almost wholly unaffected by the shock
which shattered every house and church in the city, and its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
escape from the common ruin can hardly be accounted for except
upon the supposition that its weight, compactness, and
strength of material enabled it to resist an agitation of the
earth which overthrew all weaker structures. On the other
hand, a stone pier in the harbor of Lisbon, on which thousands
of people had taken refuge, sank with its foundations to a
great depth during the same earthquake; and it is plain that
where subterranean cavities exist, at moderate depths, the erection
of heavy masses upon them would tend to promote the
breaking down of the strata which roof them over.</p>

<p>No physicist, I believe, has supposed that man can avert
the eruption of a volcano or diminish the quantity of melted
rock which it pours out of the bowels of the earth; but it is
not always impossible to divert the course of even a large current
of lava. "The smaller streams of lava near Catania,"
says Ferrara, in describing the great eruption of 1669, "were
turned from their course by building dry walls of stone as a
barrier against them. * * * It was proposed to divert
the main current from Catania, and fifty men, protected by
hides, were sent with hooks and iron bars to break the flank
of the stream near Belpasso.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> When the opening was made,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
fluid lava poured forth and flowed rapidly toward Paterno;
but the inhabitants of that place, not caring to sacrifice their
own town to save Catania, rushed out in arms and put a stop
to the operation."<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> In the eruption of Vesuvius in 1794, the
viceroy saved from impending destruction the town of Portici,
and the valuable collection of antiquities then deposited there
but since removed to Naples, by employing several thousand
men to dig a ditch above the town, by which the lava current
was carried off in another direction.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>


<h4><i>Effects of Mining.</i></h4>

<p>The excavations made by man, for mining and other purposes,
may sometimes occasion disturbance of the surface by
the subsidence of the strata above them, as in the case of the
mine of Fahlun, but such accidents must always be too inconsiderable
in extent to deserve notice in a geographical point of
view. Such excavations, however, may interfere materially
with the course of subterranean waters, and it has even been
conjectured that the removal of large bodies of metallic ore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
from their original deposits might, at least locally, affect the
magnetic and electrical condition of the earth's crust to a sensible
degree.</p>

<p>Accidental fires in mines of coal or lignite sometimes lead
to consequences not only destructive to large quantities of valuable
material, but may, directly or indirectly, produce results
important in geography. The coal occasionally takes fire from
the miners' lights or other fires used by them, and, if long exposed
to air in deserted galleries, may be spontaneously kindled.
Under favorable circumstances, a stratum of coal will
burn till it is exhausted, and a cavity may be burnt out in a
few months which human labor could not excavate in many
years. Wittwer informs us that a coal mine at St. Etienne in
Dauphiny has been burning ever since the fourteenth century,
and that a mine near Duttweiler, another near Epterode, and
a third at Zwickau, have been on fire for two hundred years.
Such conflagrations not only produce cavities in the earth, but
communicate a perceptible degree of heat to the surface, and
the author just quoted cites cases where this heat has been advantageously
employed in forcing vegetation.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Espy's Theories.</i></h4>

<p>Espy's well known suggestion of the possibility of causing
rain artificially, by kindling great fires, is not likely to be
turned to practical account, but the speculations of this able
meteorologist are not, for that reason, to be rejected as worthless.
His labors exhibit great industry in the collection of
facts, much ingenuity in dealing with them, remarkable insight
into the laws of nature, and a ready perception of analogies
and relations not obvious to minds less philosophically
constituted. They have unquestionably contributed very essentially
to the advancement of meteorological science. The
possibility that the distribution and action of electricity may
be considerably modified by long lines of iron railways and
telegraph wires, is a kindred thought, and in fact rests much
on the same foundation as the belief in the utility of lightning
rods, but such influence is too obscure and too small to have
been yet detected.</p>


<h4><i>River Sediment.</i></h4>

<p>The manifestation of the internal heat of the earth at any
given point is conditioned by the thickness of the crust at such
point. The deposits of rivers tend to augment that thickness at
their estuaries. The sediment of slowly flowing rivers emptying
into shallow seas is spread over so great a surface that we
can hardly imagine the foot or two of slime they let fall over
a wide area in a century to form an element among even the
infinitesimal quantities which compose the terms of the equations
of nature. But some swift rivers, rolling mountains of
fine earth, discharge themselves into deeply scooped gulfs or
bays, and in such cases the deposit amounts, in the course of a
few years, to a mass the transfer of which from the surface of a
large basin, and its accumulation at a single point, may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
supposed to produce other effects than those measurable by
the sounding line. Now, almost all the operations of rural
life, as I have abundantly shown, increase the liability of the
soil to erosion by water. Hence, the clearing of the valley of
the Ganges by man must have much augmented the quantity
of earth transported by that river to the sea, and of course
have strengthened the effects, whatever they may be, of thickening
the crust of the earth in the Bay of Bengal. In such
cases, then, human action must rank among geological influences.</p>


<h4><i>Nothing Small in Nature.</i></h4>

<p>It is a legal maxim that "the law concerneth not itself
with trifles," <i>de minimus non curat lex</i>; but in the vocabulary
of nature, little and great are terms of comparison only; she
knows no trifles, and her laws are as inflexible in dealing with
an atom as with a continent or a planet.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> The human opera<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>tions
mentioned in the last few paragraphs, therefore, do act in
the ways ascribed to them, though our limited faculties are at
present, perhaps forever, incapable of weighing their immediate,
still more their ultimate consequences. But our inability
to assign definite values to these causes of the disturbance
of natural arrangements is not a reason for ignoring the existence
of such causes in any general view of the relations between
man and nature, and we are never justified in assuming
a force to be insignificant because its measure is unknown, or
even because no physical effect can now be traced to it as its
origin. The collection of phenomena must precede the analysis
of them, and every new fact, illustrative of the action and
reaction between humanity and the material world around it,
is another step toward the determination of the great question,
whether man is of nature or above her.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In the Middle Ages, feudalism, and a nominal Christianity whose
corruptions had converted the most beneficent of religions into the most
baneful of superstitions, perpetuated every abuse of Roman tyranny, and
added new oppressions and new methods of extortion to those invented
by older despotisms. The burdens in question fell most heavily on the
provinces that had been longest colonized by the Latin race, and these are
the portions of Europe which have suffered the greatest physical degradation.
"Feudalism," says Blanqui, "was a concentration of scourges.
The peasant, stripped of the inheritance of his fathers, became the property
of inflexible, ignorant, indolent masters; he was obliged to travel
fifty leagues with their carts whenever they required it; he labored for
them three days in the week, and surrendered to them half the product
of his earnings during the other three; without their consent he could
not change his residence, or marry. And why, indeed, should he wish to
marry, when he could scarcely save enough to maintain himself? The
Abbot Alcuin had twenty thousand slaves, called <i>serfs</i>, who were forever
attached to the soil. This is the great cause of the rapid depopulation observed
in the Middle Ages, and of the prodigious multitude of monasteries
which sprang up on every side. It was doubtless a relief to such miserable
men to find in the cloisters a retreat from oppression; but the human
race never suffered a more cruel outrage, industry never received a wound
better calculated to plunge the world again into the darkness of the rudest
antiquity. It suffices to say that the prediction of the approaching end of
the world, industriously spread by the rapacious monks at this time, was
received without terror."&mdash;<i>R&eacute;sum&eacute; de l'Histoire du Commerce</i>, p. 156.

Paul Louis Courier quotes from La Bruy&egrave;re the following striking picture
of the condition of the French peasantry in his time: "One sees
certain dark, livid, naked, sunburnt, wild animals, male and female, scattered
over the country and attached to the soil, which they root and turn

Arthur Young, who travelled in France from 1787 to 1789, gives, in
the twenty-first chapter of his Travels, a frightful account of the burdens
of the rural population even at that late period. Besides the regular
governmental taxes, and a multitude of heavy fines imposed for trifling
offences, he enumerates about thirty seignorial rights, the very origin and
nature of some of which are now unknown, while those of some others,
claimed and enforced by ecclesiastical as well as by temporal lords, are as
repulsive to humanity and morality, as the worst abuses ever practised by
heathen despotism. Most of these, indeed, had been commuted for money
payments, and were levied on the peasantry as pecuniary imposts for the
benefit of prelates and lay lords, who, by virtue of their nobility, were
exempt from taxation. Who can wonder at the hostility of the French
plebeian classes toward the aristocracy in the days of the Revolution?</p></div>

cases, a physical, though, like fallows in agriculture, a dear-bought advantage.
Under favorable circumstances, the withdrawal of man and his
flocks allows the earth to clothe itself again with forests, and in a few
generations to recover its ancient productiveness. In the Middle Ages,
worn-out fields were depopulated, in many parts of the Continent, by civil
and ecclesiastical tyrannies, which insisted on the surrender of the half of
a loaf already too small to sustain its producer. Thus abandoned, these
lands often relapsed into the forest state, and, some centuries later, were
again brought under cultivation with renovated fertility.</p></div>

weapons, depends more upon the training of the eye than is generally
supposed, and I have often found particularly good shots to possess an
almost telescopic vision. In the ordinary use of the rifle, the barrel
serves as a guide to the eye, but there are sportsmen who fire with the
but of the gun at the hip. In this case, as in the use of the sling, the lasso,
and the bolas, in hurling the knife (see <span class="smcap">Babinet</span>, <i>Lectures</i>, vii, p. 84), in
throwing the boomerang, the javelin, or a stone, and in the employment
of the blow pipe and the bow, the movements of the hand and arm are
guided by that mysterious sympathy which exists between the eye and
the unseeing organs of the body.

In shooting the tortoises of the Amazon and its tributaries, the Indians
use an arrow with a long twine and a float attached to it. Av&eacute;-Lallemant
(<i>Die Benutzung der Palmen am Amazonenstrom</i>, p. 32) thus describes their
mode of aiming: "As the arrow, if aimed directly at the floating tortoise,
would strike it at a small angle, and glance from its flat and wet shell, the
archers have a peculiar method of shooting. They are able to calculate
exactly their own muscular effort, the velocity of the stream, the distance
and size of the tortoise, and they shoot the arrow directly up into the air,
so that it falls almost vertically upon the shell of the tortoise, and sticks
in it." Analogous calculations&mdash;if such physico-mental operations can
properly be so called&mdash;are made in the use of other missiles; for no projectile
flies in a right line to its mark. But the exact training of the eye lies
at the bottom of all of them, and marksmanship depends almost wholly upon
the power of that organ, whose directions the blind muscles implicitly
follow. It is perhaps not out of place to observe here that our English
word aim comes from the Latin &aelig;stimo, I calculate or estimate. See
<span class="smcap">Wedgwood's</span> <i>Dictionary of English Etymology</i>, and the note to the American
edition, under <i>Aim</i>.

Another proof of the control of the limbs by the eye has been observed
in deaf-and-dumb schools, and others where pupils are first taught to write
on large slates or blackboards. The writing is in large characters, the
small letters being an inch or more high. They are formed with chalk or
a slate pencil firmly grasped in the fingers, and by appropriate motions of
the wrist, elbow, and shoulder, not of the finger joints. Nevertheless,
when a pen is put into the hand of a pupil thus taught, his handwriting,
though produced by a totally different set of muscles and muscular movements,
is identical in character with that which he has practised on the
blackboard.

It has been much doubted whether the artists of the classic ages possessed
a more perfect sight than those of modern times, or whether, in executing
their minute mosaics and gem engravings, they used magnifiers.
Glasses ground convex have been found at Pompeii, but they are too
rudely fashioned and too imperfectly polished to have been of any practical
use for optical purposes. But though the ancient artists may have
had a microscopic vision, their astronomers cannot have had a telescopic
power of sight; for they did not discover the satellites of Jupiter, which
are often seen with the naked eye at Oormeeah, in Persia, and sometimes,
as I can testify by personal observation, at Cairo.

It has been said that stone weapons are not found in Sicily, except in
certain caves half filled with the skeletons of extinct animals. If they
have not been found in that island in more easily accessible localities, I
suspect it is because eyes familiar with such objects have not sought for
them. In January, 1854, I picked up an arrow head of quartz in a little
ravine or furrow just washed out by a heavy rain, in a field near the
Simeto. It is rudely fashioned, but its artificial character and its special
purpose are quite unequivocal.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Probably no cultivated vegetable affords so good an opportunity of
studying the laws of acclimation of plants as maize or Indian corn.
Maize is grown from the tropics to at least lat. 47&deg; in Northeastern
America, and farther north in Europe. Every two or three degrees of
latitude brings you to a new variety, with new climatic adaptations, and
the capacity of the plant to accommodate itself to new conditions of temperature
and season seems almost unlimited. We may easily suppose a
variety of this grain, which had become acclimated in still higher latitudes,
to have been lost, and in such case the failure to raise a crop from seed
brought from some distance to the south would not prove that the climate
had become colder.
</p><p>
Many persons now living remember that, when the common tomato
was first introduced into Northern New England, it often failed to ripen;
but, in the course of a very few years, it completely adapted itself to the
climate, and now not only matures both its fruit and its seeds with as
much certainty as any cultivated vegetable, but regularly propagates itself
by self-sown seed. Meteorological observations, however, do not show
any amelioration of the summer climate in those States within that
period. See <i>Appendix</i>, <a href="#app_1">No. 1</a>.
</p><p>
Maize and the tomato, if not new to human use, have not been long
known to civilization, and were, very probably, reclaimed and domesticated
at a much more recent period than the plants which form the great
staples of agricultural husbandry in Europe and Asia. Is the great power
of accomodation to climate possessed by them due to this circumstance?
There is some reason to suppose that the character of maize has been sensibly
changed by cultivation in South America; for, according to P&ouml;ppig,
the ears of this grain found in old Peruvian tombs belong to varieties not
now known in Peru.&mdash;<i>Travels in Peru</i>, chap. vii.</p></div>

by an Oriental in the year 1765, and it was first planted in the neighborhood
of Avignon. Of course, it has been grown in that district for less
than a century; but upon soils where it has been a frequent crop, it is
already losing much of its coloring properties.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lavergne</span>, <i>&Eacute;conomie Rurale

</p><p>
I believe there is no doubt that the cultivation of madder in the vicinity
of Avignon is of recent introduction; but it appears from Fuller and other
evidence, that this plant was grown in Europe before the middle of the
seventeenth century. The madder brought to France from Persia may be
of a different species, or, at least, variety. "Some two years since," says
Fuller, "madder was sown by Sir Nicholas Crispe at Debtford, and I hope
will have good success; first because it groweth in Zeland in the same (if
not a more <i>northern</i>) <i>latitude</i>. Secondly, because <i>wild madder</i> grows here
in abundance; and why may not <i>tame madder</i> if <i>cicurated</i> by art.

Perhaps the recent diseases of the olive, the vine, and the silkworm&mdash;the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> In many parts of New England there are tracts, miles in extent, and
presenting all varieties of surface and exposure, which were partially cleared
sixty or seventy years ago, and where little or no change in the proportion
of cultivated ground, pasturage, and woodland has taken place since. In
some cases, these tracts compose basins apparently scarcely at all exposed
to any local influence in the way of percolation or infiltration of water
toward or from neighboring valleys. But in such situations, apart from
accidental disturbances, the ground is growing drier and drier, from year
to year, springs are still disappearing, and rivulets still diminishing in their
summer supply of water. A probable explanation of this is to be found
in the rapid drainage of the surface of cleared ground, which prevents the
subterranean natural reservoirs, whether cavities or merely strata of bibulous
earth, from filling up. How long this process is to last before an
equilibrium is reached, none can say. It may be, for years; it may be, for
centuries.
</p><p>
Livingstone states facts which favor the supposition that a secular
desiccation is still going on in central Africa. When the regions where
the earth is growing drier were cleared of wood, or, indeed, whether
forests ever grew there, we are unable to say, but the change appears to
have been long in progress. There is reason to suspect a similar revolution
in Arabia Petr&aelig;a. In many of the wadis, and particularly in the gorges
between Wadi Feiran and Wadi Esh Sheikh, there are water-worn banks
showing that, at no very remote period, the winter floods must have risen
fifty feet in channels where the growth of acacias and tamarisks and the
testimony of the Arabs concur to prove that they have not risen six feet
within the memory or tradition of the present inhabitants. There is little
probability that any considerable part of the Sinaitic peninsula has been
wooded since its first occupation by man, and we must seek the cause of
its increasing dryness elsewhere than in the removal of the forest.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> The soil of newly subdued countries is generally in a high degree
favorable to the growth of the fruits of the garden and the orchard, but
usually becomes much less so in a very few years. Plums, of many varieties,
were formerly grown, in great perfection and abundance, in many
parts of New England where at present they can scarcely be reared at all;
and the peach, which, a generation or two ago, succeeded admirably in the
southern portion of the same States, has almost ceased to be cultivated
there. The disappearance of these fruits is partly due to the ravages of
insects, which have in later years attacked them; but this is evidently by
no means the sole, or even the principal cause of their decay. In these
cases, it is not to the exhaustion of the particular acres on which the fruit
trees have grown that we are to ascribe their degeneracy, but to a general
change in the condition of the soil or the air; for it is equally impossible
to rear them successfully on absolutely new land in the neighborhood of
grounds where, not long since, they bore the finest fruit.
</p><p>
I remember being told, many years ago, by one of the earliest settlers
of the State of Ohio, a very intelligent and observing person, that the
apple trees raised there from seed sown soon after the land was cleared,
bore fruit in less than half the time required to bring to bearing those
reared from seed sown when the ground had been twenty years under cultivation.
</p><p>
In the peat mosses of Denmark, Scotch firs and other trees not now
growing in the same localities, are found in abundance. Every generation
of trees leaves the soil in a different state from that in which it found it;
every tree that springs up in a group of trees of another species than its
own, grows under different influences of light and shade and atmosphere
from its predecessors. Hence the succession of crops, which occurs in all
natural forests, seems to be due rather to changes of condition than of climate.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> The nomenclature of meteorology is vague and sometimes equivocal.
Not long since, it was suspected that the observers reporting to a scientific
institution did not agree in their understanding of the mode of expressing
the direction of the wind prescribed by their instructions. It was found,
upon inquiry, that very many of them used the names of the compass-points
to indicate the quarter <i>from</i> which the wind blew, while others
employed them to signify the quarter <i>toward</i> which the atmospheric currents
were moving. In some instances, the observers were no longer
within the reach of inquiry, and of course their tables of the wind were of
no value.
</p><p>
"Winds," says Mrs. Somerville, "are named from the points whence
they blow, currents exactly the reverse. An easterly wind comes from
the east; whereas an easterly current comes from the west, and flows
toward the east."&mdash;<i>Physical Geography</i>, p. 229.
</p><p>
There is no philological ground for this distinction, and it probably
originated in a confusion of the terminations <i>-wardly</i> and <i>-erly</i>, both of
which are modern. The root of the former ending implies the direction
<i>to</i> or <i>to-ward</i> which motion is supposed. It corresponds to, and is probably
allied with, the Latin <i>versus</i>. The termination <i>-erly</i> is a corruption
or softening of <i>-ernly</i>, easterly for easternly, and many authors of the
seventeenth century so write it. In Hakluyt (i, p. 2), <i>easterly</i> is applied to
place, "<i>easterly</i> bounds," and means <i>eastern</i>. In a passage in Drayton,
"<i>easterly</i> winds" must mean winds <i>from</i> the east; but the same author, in
speaking of nations, uses <i>northerly</i> for <i>northern</i>. Hakewell says: "The
sonne cannot goe more <i>southernely</i> from vs, nor come more <i>northernely</i>
towards vs." Holland, in his translation of Pliny, referring to the moon
has: "When shee is <i>northerly</i>," and "shee is gone <i>southerly</i>." Richardson,
to whom I am indebted for the above citations, quotes a passage from
Dampier where <i>westerly</i> is applied to the wind, but the context does not
determine the direction. The only example of the termination in <i>-wardly</i>
given by this lexicographer is from Donne, where it means <i>toward</i> the
west.
</p><p>
Shakspeare, in <i>Hamlet</i> (v. ii), uses <i>northerly</i> wind for wind <i>from</i> the
north. Milton does not employ either of these terminations, nor were
they known to the Anglo-Saxons, who, however, had adjectives of direction
in <i>-an</i> or <i>-en</i>, <i>-ern</i> and <i>-weard</i>, the last always meaning the point
<i>toward</i> which motion is supposed, the others that <i>from</i> which it proceeds.
</p><p>
We use an <i>east</i> wind, an <i>eastern</i> wind, and an <i>easterly</i> wind, to signify
the same thing. The two former expressions are old, and constant in meaning;
the last is recent, superfluous, and equivocal. See <i>Appendix</i>, <a href="#app_2">No. 2</a>.</p></div>

the recuperative powers of nature, that, in twenty-five years, the ground
was thickly covered again with trees of fair dimensions, except where cultivation

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> The English nomenclature of this geographical feature does not seem
well settled. We have <i>bog</i>, <i>swamp</i>, <i>marsh</i>, <i>morass</i>,<i> moor</i>, <i>fen</i>, <i>turf moss</i>,
<i>peat moss</i>, <i>quagmire</i>, all of which, though sometimes more or less accurately
discriminated, are often used interchangeably, or are perhaps employed,
each exclusively, in a particular district. In Sweden, where,
especially in the Lappish provinces, this terr-aqueous formation is very extensive
and important, the names of its different kinds are more specific
in their application. The general designation of all soils permanently
pervaded with water is <i>K&auml;rr</i>. The elder L&aelig;stadius divides the <i>K&auml;rr</i>
into two genera: <i>Myror</i> (sing. <i>myra</i>), and <i>Mossar</i> (sing. <i>mosse</i>). "The
former," he observes, "are grass-grown, and overflowed with water
through almost the whole summer; the latter are covered with mosses
and always moist, but very seldom overflowed." He enumerates the
following species of <i>Myra</i>, the character of which will perhaps be sufficiently
understood by the Latin terms into which he translates the vernacular
names, for the benefit of strangers not altogether familiar with the
language and the subject: 1. <i>H&ouml;myror</i>, paludes graminos&aelig;. 2. <i>Dy</i>, paludes
profund&aelig;. 3. <i>Flarkmyror</i>, or proper <i>k&auml;rr</i>, paludes limos&aelig;. 4.
<i>Fj&auml;llmyror</i>, paludes uliginos&aelig;. 5. <i>Tufmyror</i>, paludes c&aelig;spitos&aelig;. 6. <i>Rismyror</i>,
paludes virgat&aelig;. 7. <i>Starr&auml;ngar</i>, prata irrigata, with their subdivisions,
dry <i>starr&auml;ngar</i> or <i>ris&auml;ngar</i>, wet <i>starr&auml;ngar</i> and <i>fr&auml;kengropar</i>. 8.
<i>P&ouml;lar</i>, laeun&aelig;. 9. <i>G&ouml;lar</i>, foss&aelig; inundat&aelig;. The <i>Mossar</i>, paludes turfos&aelig;,
which are of great extent, have but two species: 1. <i>Torfmossar</i>, called
also <i>Mossmyror</i> and <i>Snottermyror</i>, and, 2. <i>Bj&ouml;rnmossar</i>.

The accumulations of stagnant or stagnating water originating in bogs
are distinguished into <i>Tr&#257;sk</i>, stagna, and <i>Tjernar</i> or <i>Tj&auml;rnar</i> (sing. <i>Tjern</i>

from them, and their bottoms are slimy; <i>Tjernar</i> are small <i>Tr&auml;sk</i> situated
within the limits of <i>Mossar</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">L. L. L&aelig;stadius</span>, <i>om M&ouml;jligheten af Uppodlingar

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Although the quantity of bog land in New England is less than in
many other regions of equal area, yet there is a considerable extent of this
formation in some of the Northeastern States. Dana (<i>Manual of Geology</i>,
p. 614) states that the quantity of peat in Massachusetts is estimated at
120,000,000 cords, or nearly 569,000,000 cubic yards, but he does not give
either the area or the depth of the deposits. In any event, however, bogs
cover but a small percentage of the territory in any of the Northern States,
while it is said that one tenth of the whole surface of Ireland is composed
of bogs, and there are still extensive tracts of undrained marsh in England.
</p><p>
Bogs, independently of their importance in geology as explaining the
origin of some kinds of mineral coal, have a present value as repositories
of fuel. Peat beds have sometimes a thickness of ten or twelve yards, or
even more. A depth of ten yards would give 48,000 cubic yards to the
acre. The greatest quantity of firewood yielded by the forests of New
England to the acre is 100 cords solid measure, or 474 cubic yards; but
this comprises only the trunks and larger branches. If we add the small
branches and twigs, it is possible that 600 cubic yards might, in some cases,
be cut on an acre. This is only one eightieth part of the quantity of
peat sometimes found on the same area. It is true that a yard of peat and
a yard of wood are not the equivalents of each other, but the fuel on an
acre of deep peat is worth much more than that on an acre of the best
woodland. Besides this, wood is perishable, and the quantity on an acre
cannot be increased beyond the amount just stated; peat is indestructible,
and the beds are always growing.</p></div>

locust, <i>Robinia pseudacacia</i>, is one of these, and its ravages have been
and still are most destructive to that very valuable tree, so remarkable for
combining rapidity of growth with strength and durability of wood. This
insect, I believe, has not yet appeared in Europe, where, since the so general
employment of the <i>Robinia</i> to clothe and protect embankments and
the scarps of deep cuts on railroads, it would do incalculable mischief. As
a traveller, however, I should find some compensation for this evil in the
destruction of these acacia hedges, which as completely obstruct the view
on hundreds of miles of French and Italian railways, as the garden walls
of the same countries do on the ordinary roads. See <i>Appendix</i>, <a href="#app_4">No. 4</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> In the artificial woods of Europe, insects are far more numerous and
destructive to trees than in the primitive forests of America, and the same
remark may be made of the smaller rodents, such as moles, mice, and
squirrels. In the dense native wood, the ground and the air are too
humid, the depth of shade too great for many tribes of these creatures,
while near the natural meadows and other open grounds, where circumstances
are otherwise more favorable for their existence and multiplication,
their numbers are kept down by birds, serpents, foxes, and smaller
predacious quadrupeds. In civilized countries, these natural enemies of
the worm, the beetle and the mole, are persecuted, sometimes almost exterminated,
by man, who also removes from his plantations the decayed
or wind-fallen trees, the shrubs and underwood, which, in a state of
nature, furnished food and shelter to the borer and the rodent, and often
also to the animals that preyed upon them. Hence the insect and the
gnawing quadruped are allowed to increase, from the expulsion of the
police which, in the natural wood, prevent their excessive multiplication,
and they become destructive to the forest because they are driven to the
living tree for nutriment and cover. The forest of Fontainebleau is almost
wholly without birds, and their absence is ascribed by some writers to
the want of water, which, in the thirsty sands of that wood, does not
gather into running brooks; but the want of undergrowth is perhaps
an equally good reason for their scarcity. In a wood of spontaneous
growth, ordered and governed by nature, the squirrel does not attack
trees, or at least the injury he may do is too trifling to be perceptible, but
he is a formidable enemy to the plantation. "The squirrels bite the cones
of the pine and consume the seed which might serve to restock the wood;
they do still more mischief by gnawing off, near the leading shoot, a strip
of bark, and thus often completely girdling the tree. Trees so injured
must be felled, as they would never acquire a vigorous growth. The
squirrel is especially destructive to the pine in Sologne, where he gnaws
the bark of tress twenty or twenty-five years old." But even here, nature
sometimes provides a compensation, by making the appetite of this quadruped
serve to prevent an excessive production of seed cones, which tends
to obstruct the due growth of the leading shoot. "In some of the pineries
of Brittany which produce cones so abundantly as to strangle the development
of the leading shoot of the maritime pine, it has been observed that
the pines are most vigorous where the squirrels are most numerous, a result
attributed to the repression of the cones by this rodent."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Boitel</span>, <i>Mise en

chase of large mammalia and birds for single products, attended with the
entire waste of enormous quantities of flesh, and of other parts of the animal,
which are capable of valuable uses. The wild cattle of South America
are slaughtered by millions for their hides and horns; the buffalo of North
America for his skin or his tongue; the elephant, the walrus, and the
narwhal for their tusks; the cetacea, and some other marine animals, for
their oil and whalebone; the ostrich and other large birds, for their
plumage. Within a few years, sheep have been killed in New England by
whole flocks, for their pelts and suet alone, the flesh being thrown away;
and it is even said that the bodies of the same quadrupeds have been used
in Australia as fuel for limekilns. What a vast amount of human nutriment,
of bone, and of other animal products valuable in the arts, is thus
recklessly squandered! In nearly all these cases, the part which constitutes
the motive for this wholesale destruction, and is alone saved, is
essentially of insignificant value as compared with what is thrown away.
The horns and hide of an ox are not economically worth a tenth part as
much as the entire carcass.
</p><p>
One of the greatest benefits to be expected from the improvements of
civilization is, that increased facilities of communication will render it possible
to transport to places of consumption much valuable material that is
now wasted because the price at the nearest market will not pay freight.
The cattle slaughtered in South America for their hides would feed millions
of the starving population of the Old World, if their flesh could be
economically preserved and transported across the ocean.
</p><p>
We are beginning to learn a better economy in dealing with the inorganic
world. The utilization&mdash;or, as the Germans more happily call it,
the Verwerthung, the <i>beworthing</i>&mdash;of waste from metallurgical, chemical,
and manufacturing establishments, is among the most important results of
the application of science to industrial purposes. The incidental products
from the laboratories of manufacturing chemists often become more valuable
than those for the preparation of which they were erected. The slags
from silver refineries, and even from smelting houses of the coarser metals,
have not unfrequently yielded to a second operator a better return than
the first had derived from dealing with the natural ore; and the saving of
lead carried off in the smoke of furnaces has, of itself, given a large profit
on the capital invested in the works. A few years ago, an officer of an
American mint was charged with embezzling gold committed to him for
coinage. He insisted, in his defence, that much of the metal was volatilized
and lost in refining and melting, and upon scraping the chimneys
of the melting furnaces and the roofs of the adjacent houses, gold enough
was found in the soot to account for no small part of the deficiency.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> It is an interesting and not hitherto sufficiently noticed fact, that the
domestication of the organic world, so far as it has yet been achieved, belongs,
not indeed to the savage state, but to the earliest dawn of civilization,
the conquest of inorganic nature almost as exclusively to the most advanced
stages of artificial culture. It is familiarly known to all who have occupied
themselves with the psychology and habits of the ruder races, and of persons
with imperfectly developed intellects in civilized life, that although
these humble tribes and individuals sacrifice, without scruple, the lives of
the lower animals to the gratification of their appetites and the supply of
their other physical wants, yet they nevertheless seem to cherish with
brutes, and even with vegetable life, sympathies which are much more
feebly felt by civilized men. The popular traditions of the simpler peoples
recognize a certain community of nature between man, brute animals, and
even plants; and this serves to explain why the apologue or fable, which
ascribes the power of speech and the faculty of reason to birds, quadrupeds,
insects, flowers, and trees, is one of the earliest forms of literary composition.
</p><p>
In almost every wild tribe, some particular quadruped or bird, though
persecuted as a destroyer of more domestic beasts, or hunted for food, is
regarded with peculiar respect, one might almost say, affection. Some of
the North American aboriginal nations celebrate a propitiatory feast to the
manes of the intended victim before they commence a bear hunt; and the
Norwegian peasantry have not only retained an old proverb which ascribes
to the same animal "<i>ti M&#339;nds Styrke og tolv M&#339;nds Vid</i>," ten men's
strength and twelve men's cunning, but they still pay to him something
of the reverence with which ancient superstition invested him. The
student of Icelandic literature will find in the saga of <i>Finnbogi hinn rami</i>
a curious illustration of this feeling, in an account of a dialogue between a
Norwegian bear and an Icelandic champion&mdash;dumb show on the part of
Bruin, and chivalric words on that of Finnbogi&mdash;followed by a duel, in
which the latter, who had thrown away his arms and armor in order that
the combatants might meet on equal terms, was victorious. Drummond
Hay's very interesting work on Morocco contains many amusing notices
of a similar feeling entertained by the Moors toward the redoubtable
enemy of their flocks&mdash;the lion.
</p><p>
This sympathy helps us to understand how it is that most if not all
the domestic animals&mdash;if indeed they ever existed in a wild state&mdash;were
appropriated, reclaimed and trained before men had been gathered into
organized and fixed communities, that almost every known esculent plant
had acquired substantially its present artificial character, and that the
properties of nearly all vegetable drugs and poisons were known at the
remotest period to which historical records reach. Did nature bestow
upon primitive man some instinct akin to that by which she teaches the
brute to select the nutritious and to reject the noxious vegetables indiscriminately
mixed in forest and pasture?
</p><p>
This instinct, it must be admitted, is far from infallible, and, as has
been hundreds of times remarked by naturalists, it is in many cases not an
original faculty but an acquired and transmitted habit. It is a fact familiar
to persons engaged in sheep husbandry in New England&mdash;and I have seen
it confirmed by personal observation&mdash;that sheep bred where the common
laurel, as it is called, <i>Kalmia angustifolia</i>, abounds, almost always avoid
browsing upon the leaves of that plant, while those brought from districts
where laurel is unknown, and turned into pastures where it grows, very
often feed upon it and are poisoned by it. A curious acquired and hereditary
instinct, of a different character, may not improperly be noticed here.
I refer to that by which horses bred in provinces where quicksands are
common avoid their dangers or extricate themselves from them. See
<span class="smcap">Br&eacute;montier</span>, <i>M&eacute;moire sur les Dunes, Annales des Ponts et Chauss&eacute;es</i>, 1833:
<i>premier s&eacute;mestre</i>, pp. 155-157.
</p><p>
It is commonly said in New England, and I believe with reason, that
the crows of this generation are wiser than their ancestors. Scarecrows
which were effectual fifty years ago are no longer respected by the plunderers
of the cornfield, and new terrors must from time to time be invented
for its protection. See <i>Appendix</i>, <a href="#app_6">No. 6</a>.
</p><p>
Civilization has added little to the number of vegetable or animal
species grown in our fields or bred in our folds, while, on the contrary,
the subjugation of the inorganic forces, and the consequent extension of
man's sway over, not the annual products of the earth only, but her substance
and her springs of action, is almost entirely the work of highly refined
and cultivated ages. The employment of the elasticity of wood and
of horn, as a projectile power in the bow, is nearly universal among the
rudest savages. The application of compressed air to the same purpose, in
the blowpipe, is more restricted, and the use of the mechanical powers,
the inclined plane, the wheel and axle, and even the wedge and lever,
seems almost unknown except to civilized man. I have myself seen European
peasants to whom one of the simplest applications of this latter
power was a revelation.</p></div>

civilization, to nature, is well seen in that part of the valley of the Mississippi

the far less developed Indian tribes. When the tillers of the fields, which
must have been cultivated to sustain the large population that once inhabited

normal forest state, and the savages who succeeded the more advanced

The seaward front of the breakwater at Cherbourg exposes a surface
of about 2,500,000 square feet. In rough weather the waves beat against
this whole face, though at the depth of twenty-two yards, which is the
height of the breakwater, they exert a very much less violent motive force
than at and near the surface of the sea, because this force diminishes in
geometrical, as the distance below the surface increases in arithmetical proportion.
The shock of the waves is received several thousand times in the
course of twenty-four hours, and hence the sum of impulse which the
breakwater resists in one stormy day amounts to many thousands of
millions of tons. The breakwater is entirely an artificial construction.

But, in hilly regions, the law is reversed in cold, still weather, the cold air
descending, by reason of its greater gravity, into the valleys. If there be
wind enough, however, to produce a disturbance and intermixture of
higher and lower atmospheric strata, this exception to the general law
does not take place. These facts have long been familiar to the common
people of Switzerland and of New England, but their importance has not
been sufficiently taken into account in the discussion of meteorological
observations. The descent of the cold air and the rise of the warm affect
the relative temperatures of hills and valleys to a much greater extent than
has been usually supposed. A gentleman well known to me kept a thermometrical
record for nearly half a century, in a New England country
town, at an elevation of at least 1,500 feet above the sea. During these
years his thermometer never fell lower than 26&deg; Fahrenheit, while at the

no souls; their managers, in general, no consciences. Cases can be cited
where engineers and directors of railroads, with long grades above one
hundred feet to the mile, have regularly sworn in their annual reports, for
years in succession, that there were no grades upon their routes exceeding
half that elevation. In fact, every person conversant with the history of
these enterprises knows that in their public statements falsehood is the

What I am about to remark is not exactly relevant to my subject; but
it is hard to "get the floor" in the world's great debating society, and
when a speaker who has anything to say once finds access to the public
ear, he must make the most of his opportunity, without inquiring too nicely
whether his observations are "in order." I shall harm no honest man by
endeavoring, as I have often done elsewhere, to excite the attention of
thinking and conscientious men to the dangers which threaten the great
moral and even political interests of Christendom, from the unscrupulousness
of the private associations that now control the monetary affairs, and
regulate the transit of persons and property, in almost every civilized
country. More than one American State is literally governed by unprincipled
corporations, which not only defy the legislative power, but have,
too often, corrupted even the administration of justice. Similar evils
have become almost equally rife in England, and on the Continent; and I
believe the decay of commercial morality, and indeed of the sense of all
higher obligations than those of a pecuniary nature, on both sides of the
Atlantic, is to be ascribed more to the influence of joint-stock banks and
manufacturing and railway companies, to the workings, in short, of what is
called the principle of "associate action," than to any other one cause of
demoralization.
</p><p>
The apophthegm, "the world is governed too much," though unhappily
too truly spoken of many countries&mdash;and perhaps, in some aspects,
true of all&mdash;has done much mischief whenever it has been too unconditionally
accepted as a political axiom. The popular apprehension of
being over-governed, and, I am afraid, more emphatically the fear of being
over-taxed, has had much to do with the general abandonment of certain
governmental duties by the ruling powers of most modern states. It is
theoretically the duty of government to provide all those public facilities
of intercommunication and commerce, which are essential to the prosperity
of civilized commonwealths, but which individual means are inadequate
to furnish, and for the due administration of which individual guaranties
are insufficient. Hence public roads, canals, railroads, postal communications,
the circulating medium of exchange, whether metallic or representative,
armies, navies, being all matters in which the nation at large
has a vastly deeper interest than any private association can have, ought
legitimately to be constructed and provided only by that which is the visible
personification and embodiment of the nation, namely, its legislative
head. No doubt the organization and management of these institutions
by government are liable, as are all things human, to great abuses. The
multiplication of public placeholders, which they imply, is a serious evil.
But the corruption thus engendered, foul as it is, does not strike so deep as
the rottenness of private corporations; and official rank, position, and duty
have, in practice, proved better securities for fidelity and pecuniary integrity
in the conduct of the interests in question, than the suretyships of
private corporate agents, whose bondsmen so often fail or abscond before
their principal is detected.
</p><p>
Many theoretical statesmen have thought that voluntary associations
for strictly pecuniary and industrial purposes, and for the construction and
control of public works, might furnish, in democratic countries, a compensation
for the small and doubtful advantages, and at the same time secure
an exemption from the great and certain evils, of aristocratic institutions.
The example of the American States shows that private corporations&mdash;whose
rule of action is the interest of the association, not the conscience
of the individual&mdash;though composed of ultra-democratic elements, may
become most dangerous enemies to rational liberty, to the moral interests
of the commonwealth, to the purity of legislation and of judicial action,
and to the sacredness of private rights.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_38" id="Footnote_38_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> It is impossible to say how far the abstraction of water from the earth
by broad-leaved field and garden plants&mdash;such as maize, the gourd family,
the cabbage, &amp;c.&mdash;is compensated by the condensation of dew, which sometimes
pours from them in a stream, by the exhalation of aqueous vapor
from their leaves, which is directly absorbed by the ground, and by the
shelter they afford the soil from sun and wind, thus preventing evaporation.
American farmers often say that after the leaves of Indian corn
are large enough to "shade the ground," there is little danger that the
plants will suffer from drought; but it is probable that the comparative
security of the fields from this evil is in part due to the fact that, at this
period of growth, the roots penetrate down to a permanently humid
stratum of soil, and draw from it the moisture they require. Stirring the
ground between the rows of maize with a light harrow or cultivator, in
very dry seasons, is often recommended as a preventive of injury by
drought. It would seem, indeed, that loosening and turning over the surface
earth might aggravate the evil by promoting the evaporation of the
little remaining moisture; but the practice is founded partly on the belief
that the hygroscopicity of the soil is increased by it to such a degree that
it gains more by absorption than it loses by evaporation, and partly on the
doctrine that to admit air to the rootlets, or at least to the earth near
them, is to supply directly elements of vegetable growth.</p></div>

into their commerce as a regular article of importation. The early voyagers
found it in common use in the West Indies and in the provinces first
colonized by the Spaniards; but it was introduced into the territory of the
United States by European settlers, and did not become of any importance
until after the Revolution. Cotton seed was sown in Virginia as early as
1621, but was not cultivated with a view to profit for more than a century

A correspondent of the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, in describing the newly excavated
villa, which has been named Livia's Villa, near the Porta del Popolo at
Rome, states that: "The walls of one of the rooms are, singularly enough,
decorated with landscape paintings, a grove of palm and <i>orange</i> trees, with
fruits and birds on the branches&mdash;the colors all as fresh and lively as if
painted yesterday." The writer remarks on the character of this decoration
as something very unusual in Roman architecture; and if the trees in
question are really orange, and not lemon trees, this circumstance may
throw some doubt on the antiquity of the painting. If, on the other hand,
it proves really ancient, it shows that the orange was known to the Roman
painters, if not gardeners. The landscape may perhaps represent Oriental,
not European scenery. The accessories of the picture would probably determine
that question.&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, No. 1859, June 13, 1863.

Dr. Dwight remarks that the seeds of American forest trees will not
vegetate when dropped on grassland. This is one of the very few errors
of personal observation to be found in that author's writings. There are
seasons, indeed, when few tree seeds germinate in the meadows and the
pastures, and years favorable to one species are not always propitious to
another; but there is no American forest tree known to me which does
not readily propagate itself by seed in the thickest greensward, if its germs
are not disturbed by man or animals.</p></div>

countries into which it has been introduced the cuttings have been taken
from the male, and as, consequently, males only have grown from them,
the poplar does not produce seed in those regions. This is a fortunate circumstance,
for otherwise this most worthless and least ornamental of trees

mysterious diseases which have, for the last twenty years, so injuriously
affected the potato, the vine, the orange, the olive, and silk husbandry&mdash;whether
in this case the malady resides in the mulberry or in the insect&mdash;are
ascribed by some to a climatic deterioration produced by excessive destruction
of the woods. As will be seen in the next chapter, a retardation
in the period of spring has been observed in numerous localities in Southern
Europe, as well as in the United States. This change has been
thought to favor the multiplication of the obscure parasites which cause
the injury to the vegetables just mentioned.
</p><p>
Babinet supposes the parasites which attack the grape and the potato
to be animal, not vegetable, and he ascribes their multiplication to excessive
manuring and stimulation of the growth of the plants on which
they live. They are now generally, if not universally, regarded as vegetable,
and if they are so, Babinet's theory would be even more plausible than
on his own supposition.&mdash;<i>&Eacute;tudes et Lectures</i>, ii, p. 269.
</p><p>
It is a fact of some interest in agricultural economy, that the oidium,
which is so destructive to the grape, has produced no pecuniary loss to the
proprietors of the vineyards in France. "The price of wine," says Lavergne,
"has quintupled, and as the product of the vintage has not diminished
in the same proportion, the crisis has been, on the whole, rather advantageous
than detrimental to the country."&mdash;<i>&Eacute;conomie Rurale de la
France</i>, pp. 263, 264.
</p><p>
France produces a considerable surplus of wines for exportation, and
the sales to foreign consumers are the principal source of profit to French
vinegrowers. In Northern Italy, on the contrary, which exports little
wine, there has been no such increase in the price of wine as to compensate
the great diminution in the yield of the vines, and the loss of this harvest
is severely felt. In Sicily, however, which exports much wine, prices
have risen as rapidly as in France. Waltershausen informs us that in the
years 1838-'42, the red wine of Mount Etna sold at the rate of one
kreuzer and a half, or one cent the bottle, and sometimes even at but two
thirds that price, but that at present it commands five or six times as
much.
</p><p>
The grape disease has operated severely on small cultivators whose
vineyards only furnished a supply for domestic use, but Sicily has received
a compensation in the immense increase which it has occasioned in both
the product and the profits of the sulphur mines. Flour of sulphur is applied
to the vine as a remedy against the disease, and the operation is
repeated from two to three or four&mdash;and even, it is said, eight or ten times&mdash;in
a season. Hence there is a great demand for sulphur in all the vine-growing
countries of Europe, and Waltershausen estimates the annual
consumption of that mineral for this single purpose at 850,000 <i>centner</i>, or
more than forty thousand tons. The price of sulphur has risen in about
the same proportion as that of wine.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Waltershausen</span>, <i>Ueber den Sicilianischen

worthy of special notice. "The soil of the Haur&acirc;n," he remarks, "produces,
in its primitive condition, much wild rye, which is not known as a cultivated

resemble the corresponding cultivated plants in leaf, ear, size, and

and the cerealia. The wild orange of Florida, though once considered
indigenous, is now generally thought by botanists to be descended
from the European orange introduced by the early colonists. The fig and
the olive are found growing wild in every country where those trees are
cultivated. The wild fig differs from the domesticated in its habits, its
season of fructification, and its insect population, but is, I believe, not
specifically distinguishable from the garden fig, though I do not know that
it is reclaimable by cultivation. The wild olive, which is so abundant in
the Tuscan Maremma, produces good fruit without further care, when
thinned out and freed from the shade of other trees, and is particularly
suited for grafting. See <span class="smcap">Salvagnoli</span>, <i>Memorie sulle Maremme</i>, pp.

<span class="smcap">Fraas</span>, <i>Klima und Pflanzenwelt in der Zeit</i>, pp. 35-38, gives, upon the
authority of Link and other botanical writers, a list of the native habitats
of most cereals and of many fruits, or at least of localities where these
plants are said to be now found wild; but the data do not appear to rest,
in general, upon very trustworthy evidence. Theoretically, there can be
little doubt that all our cultivated plants are modified forms of spontaneous
vegetation, but the connection is not historically shown, nor are we able to
say that the originals of some domesticated vegetables may not be now extinct
and unrepresented in the existing wild flora. See, on this subject,
<span class="smcap">Humboldt</span>, <i>Ansichten der Natur</i>, i, pp. 208, 209. The following are interesting
incidents: "A negro slave of the great Cortez was the first who
sowed wheat in New Spain. He found three grains of it among the rice
which had been brought from Spain as food for the soldiers. In the Franciscan
monastery at Quito, I saw the earthen pot which contained the first
wheat sown there by Friar Jodoco Rixi, of Ghent. It was preserved as a
relic."

The Adams of modern botany and zoology have been put to hard shifts in
finding names for the multiplied organisms which the Creator has brought
before them, "to see what they would call them;" and naturalists and
philosophers have shown much moral courage in setting at naught the laws
of philology in the coinage of uncouth words to express scientific ideas. It
is much to be wished that some bold neologist would devise English technical
equivalents for the German <i>verwildert</i>, run-wild, and <i>veredelt</i>, improved
by cultivation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_59_59" id="Footnote_59_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_59"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> Could the bones and other relics of the domestic quadrupeds destroyed
by disease or slaughtered for human use in civilized countries be collected
into large deposits, as obscure causes have gathered together those of extinct
animals, they would soon form aggregations which might almost be
called mountains. There were in the United States, in 1860, as we shall
see hereafter, nearly one hundred and two millions of horses, black cattle,
sheep, and swine. There are great numbers of all the same animals in the
British American Provinces, and in Mexico, and there are large herds of
wild horses on the plains, and of tamed among the independent Indian
tribes of North America. It would perhaps not be extravagant to suppose
that all those cattle may amount to two thirds as many as those of the
United States, and thus we have in North America a total of 170,000,000
domestic quadrupeds belonging to species introduced by European colonization,
besides dogs, cats, and other four-footed household pets and pests,
also of foreign origin.
</p><p>
If we allow half a solid foot to the skeleton and other slowly destructible
parts of each animal, the remains of these herds would form a cubical
mass measuring not much short of four hundred and fifty feet to the side,
or a pyramid equal in dimensions to that of Cheops, and as the average life
of these animals does not exceed six or seven years, the accumulations of
their bones, horns, hoofs, and other durable remains would amount to at
least fifteen times as great a volume in a single century. It is true that
the actual mass of solid matter, left by the decay of dead domestic quadrupeds
and permanently added to the crust of the earth, is not so great as
this calculation makes it. The greatest proportion of the soft parts of domestic
animals, and even of the bones, is soon decomposed, through direct
consumption by man and other carnivora, industrial use, and employment
as manure, and enters into new combinations in which its animal origin is
scarcely traceable; there is, nevertheless, a large annual residuum, which,
like decayed vegetable matter, becomes a part of the superficial mould;
and in any event, brute life immensely changes the form and character of
the superficial strata, if it does not sensibly augment the quantity of the
matter composing them.
</p><p>
The remains of man, too, add to the earthy coating that covers the
face of the globe. The human bodies deposited in the catacombs during
the long, long ages of Egyptian history, would perhaps build as large a
pile as one generation of the quadrupeds of the United States. In the
barbarous days of old Moslem warfare, the conquerors erected large pyramids
of human skulls. The soil of cemeteries in the great cities of Europe
has sometimes been raised several feet by the deposit of the dead during a
few generations. In the East, Turks and Christians alike bury bodies but
a couple of feet beneath the surface. The grave is respected as long as the
tombstone remains, but the sepultures of the ignoble poor, and of those
whose monuments time or accident has removed, are opened again and
again to receive fresh occupants. Hence the ground in Oriental cemeteries
is pervaded with relics of humanity, if not wholly composed of them; and
an examination of the soil of the lower part of the <i>Petit Champ des Morts</i>
at Pera, by the naked eye alone, shows the observer that it consists almost
exclusively of the comminuted bones of his fellow man.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_60_60" id="Footnote_60_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60_60"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> It is asserted that the bones of mammoths and mastodons, in many
instances, appear to have been grazed or cut by flint arrow-heads or other
stone weapons. These accounts have often been discredited, because it
has been assumed that the extinction of these animals was more ancient
than the existence of man. Recent discoveries render it highly probable,
if not certain, that this conclusion has been too hastily adopted. Lyell
observes: "These stories * * must in future be more carefully inquired
into, for we can scarcely doubt that the mastodon in North America lived
down to a period when the mammoth coexisted with man in Europe."&mdash;<i>Antiquity
of Man</i>, p. 354.
</p><p>
On page 143 of the volume just quoted, the same very distinguished
writer remarks that man "no doubt played his part in hastening the era
of the extinction" of the large pachyderms and beasts of prey; but, as
contemporaneous species of other animals, which man cannot be supposed,
to have extirpated, have also become extinct, he argues that the disappearance
of the quadrupeds in question cannot be ascribed to human
action alone.
</p><p>
On this point it may be observed that, as we cannot know what precise
physical conditions were necessary to the existence of a given extinct organism,
we cannot say how far such conditions may have been modified
by the action of man, and he may therefore have influenced the life of
such organisms in ways, and to an extent, of which we can form no
just idea.</p></div>

bodies, is wholesome and marvellously cherishing."&mdash;<i>Terra, or Philosophical

In a note upon this passage, Hunter observes: "Nice farmers consider
the lying of a beast upon the ground, for one night only, as a sufficient

certainly enrich the roots of grass; a circumstance worthy of the attention

by every ship that sails from Europe to a foreign port, and several
species of these quadrupeds have, consequently, much extended their
range and increased their numbers in modern times. From a story of
Heliogabalus related by Lampridius, <i>Hist. Aug. Scriptores</i>, ed. Casaubon,
1690, p. 110, it would seem that mice at least were not very common in
ancient Rome. Among the capricious freaks of that emperor, it is said
that he undertook to investigate the statistics of the arachnoid population
of the capital, and that 10,000 pounds of spiders (or spiders' webs&mdash;for
aranea is equivocal) were readily collected; but when he got up a mouse
show, he thought ten thousand mice a very fair number. I believe as
many might almost be found in a single palace in modern Rome. Rats are
not less numerous in all great cities, and in Paris, where their skins are
used for gloves, and their flesh, it is whispered, in some very complex and
equivocal dishes, they are caught by legions. I have read of a manufacturer
who contracted to buy of the rat catchers, at a high price, all the
rat skins they could furnish before a certain date, and failed, within a week,
for want of capital, when the stock of peltry had run up to 600,000.</p></div>

breaking up the new soil of the prairies with its strong matting of native
grasses, and for the transportation of heavy loads over the rough roads of
the interior. In all these cases, the frequent obstructions to the passage
of the timber, the plough, and the sled or cart, are a source of constant
danger to the animals, the vehicles, and the harness, and the slow and
steady step of the ox is attended with much less risk than the swift and
sudden movements of the impatient horse. It is surprising to see the
sagacity with which the dull and clumsy ox&mdash;hampered as he is by the
rigid yoke, the most absurd implement of draught ever contrived by man&mdash;picks
his way, when once trained to forest work, among rocks and roots,
and even climbs over fallen trees, not only moving safely, but drawing
timber over ground wholly impracticable for the light and agile horse.

Cows, so constantly employed for draught in Italy, are never yoked or
otherwise used for labor in America, except in the Slave States.</p></div>

any personal knowledge, and who continued to indulge his favorite passion
much beyond the age which generally terminates exploits in woodcraft,
lamented on his deathbed that he had not lived long enough to carry up
the record of his slaughtered deer to the number of one thousand, which
he had fixed as the limit of his ambition. He was able to handle the rifle,
for sixty years, at a period when the game was still nearly as abundant as
ever, but had killed only nine hundred and sixty of these quadrupeds, of
all species. The exploits of this Nimrod have been far exceeded by prairie
hunters, but I doubt whether, in the originally wooded territory of the
Union, any single marksman has brought down a larger number.</p></div>

From the anatomical character of the bones of the urus, or auerochs,
found among the relics of the lacustrine population of ancient Switzerland,
and from other circumstances, it is inferred that this animal had been domesticated
by that people; and it is stated, I know not upon what authority,
in <i>Le Alpi che cingono l'Italia</i>, that it had been tamed by the Veneti
also. See <span class="smcap">Lyell</span>, <i>Antiquity of Man</i>, pp. 24, 25, and the last-named work,
p. 489. This is a fact of much interest, because it is, I believe, the only
known instance of the extinction of a domestic quadruped, and the extreme
improbability of such an event gives some countenance to the theory of
the identity of the domestic ox with, and its descent from, the urus.</p></div>

The testimony of the <i>Nibelungen-Lied</i> is not conclusive evidence that
these quadrupeds existed in Germany at the time of the composition of

of very considerable width by swimming. By way of giving me an idea of
the former abundance of this bird, an old and highly respectable gentleman
who was among the early white settlers of the West, told me that he
once counted, in walking down the northern bank of the Ohio River, within
a distance of four miles, eighty-four turkeys as they landed singly, or at
most in pairs, after swimming over from the Kentucky side.</p></div>

also, when pains have been taken to exterminate the hawk. The pigeons,
which migrated in flocks so numerous that they were whole days in passing
a given point, were no doubt injurious to the grain, but probably less
so than is generally supposed; for they did not confine themselves exclusively
to the harvests for their nourishment.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_73_73" id="Footnote_73_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73_73"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> Pigeons were shot near Albany, in New York, a few years ago, with

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_74_74" id="Footnote_74_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74_74"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> Professor Treadwell, of Massachusetts, found that a half-grown
American robin in confinement ate in one day sixty-eight earthworms,
weighing together nearly once and a half as much as the bird himself, and
another had previously starved upon a daily allowance of eight or ten
worms, or about twenty per cent. of his own weight. The largest of these
numbers appeared, so far as could be judged by watching parent birds of the
same species, as they brought food to their young, to be much greater than
that supplied to them when fed in the nest; for the old birds did not return
with worms or insects oftener than once in ten minutes on an average. If
we suppose the parents to hunt for food twelve hours in a day, and a nest
to contain four young, we should have seventy-two worms, or eighteen
each, as the daily supply of the brood. It is probable enough that some
of the food collected by the parents may be more nutritious than the earthworms,
and consequently that a smaller quantity sufficed for the young in
the nest than when reared under artificial conditions.
</p><p>
The supply required by growing birds is not the measure of their wants
after they have arrived at maturity, and it is not by any means certain
that great muscular exertion always increases the demand for nourishment,
either in the lower animals or in man. The members of the English
Alpine Club are not distinguished for appetites which would make them
unwelcome guests to Swiss landlords, and I think every man who has had
the personal charge of field or railway hands, must have observed that
laborers who spare their strength the least are not the most valiant
trencher champions. During the period when imprisonment for debt
was permitted in New England, persons confined in country jails had no
specific allowance, and they were commonly fed without stint. I have
often inquired concerning their diet, and been assured by the jailers that
their prisoners, who were not provided with work or other means of exercise,
consumed a considerably larger supply of food than common out-door
laborers.</p></div>

newspaper, of December 15, 1862, the following article communicated to
a country paper by a person who signs himself "A real friend to the

</p><p>
"<i>Crawley Sparrow Club.</i>&mdash;The annual dinner took place at the George

Worth, having destroyed within the last year 1,467. Mr. Heayman took
the second with 1,448 destroyed. Mr. Stone, third, with 982 affixed.

This trio of valiant fowlers, and their less fortunate&mdash;or rather less
unfortunate, but not therefore less guilty&mdash;associates, have rescued by their
prowess, it may be, a score of pecks of grain from being devoured by the
voracious sparrow, but every one of the twelve thousand hatched and unhatched
birds, thus sacrificed to puerile vanity and ignorant prejudice,
would have saved his bushel of wheat by preying upon insects that destroy
the grain. Mr. Redford, Mr. Heayman, and Mr. Stone ought to contribute
the value of the bread they have wasted to the fund for the benefit of the
Lancashire weavers; and it is to be hoped that the next Byron will satirize
the sparrowcide as severely as the first did the prince of anglers, Walton,
in the well known lines:

Tschudi has collected in his little work, <i>Ueber die Landwirthschaftliche
Bedeutung der V&ouml;gel</i>, many interesting facts respecting the utility of birds,
and the wanton destruction of them in Italy and elsewhere. Not only the
owl, but many other birds more familiarly known as predacious in their
habits, are useful by destroying great numbers of mice and moles. The
importance of this last service becomes strikingly apparent when it is
known that the burrows of the mole are among the most frequent causes
of rupture in the dikes of the Po, and, consequently, of inundations which
lay many square miles under water.&mdash;<i>Annales des Ponts et Chauss&eacute;es</i>, 1847,
1re s&eacute;mestre, p. 150. See also <span class="smcap">Vogt</span>, <i>N&uuml;tzliche u. sch&auml;dliche Thiere</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_78_78" id="Footnote_78_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78_78"><span class="label">[78]</span></a>  Wild birds are very tenacious in their habits. The extension of particular
branches of agriculture introduces new birds; but unless in the case
of such changes in physical conditions, particular species seem indissolubly
attached to particular localities. The migrating tribes follow almost undeviatingly
the same precise line of flight in their annual journeys, and
establish themselves in the same breeding places from year to year. The
stork is a strong-winged bird and roves far for food, but very rarely establishes
new colonies. He is common in Holland, but unknown in England.
Not above five or six pairs of storks commonly breed in the suburbs of
Constantinople along the European shore of the narrow Bosphorus, while&mdash;much
to the satisfaction of the Moslems, who are justly proud of the
marked partiality of so orthodox a bird&mdash;dozens of chimneys of the true
believers on the Asiatic side are crowned with his nests. See <i>App.</i> <a href="#app_15">No. 15</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_79_79" id="Footnote_79_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79_79"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> It is not the unfledged and the nursing bird alone that are exposed
to destruction by severe weather. Whole flocks of adult and strong-winged
tribes are killed by hail. Severe winters are usually followed by
a sensible diminution in the numbers of the non-migrating birds, and a
cold storm in summer often proves fatal to the more delicate species. On
the 10th of June, 184-, five or six inches of snow fell in Northern Vermont.
The next morning I found a humming bird killed by the cold, and hanging
by its claws just below a loose clapboard on the wall of a small wooden
building where it had sought shelter.</p></div>

that the number of those which die every year equals the aggregate number
by which the species to which they respectively belong is, on the
average, permanently represented."
</p><p>
A remarkable instance of the influence of new circumstances upon birds
was observed upon the establishment of a lighthouse on Cape Cod some
years since. The morning after the lamps were lighted for the first time,
more than a hundred dead birds of several different species, chiefly water
fowl, were found at the foot of the tower. They had been killed in the
course of the night by flying against the thick glass or grating of the
lantern. See <i>Appendix</i>, <a href="#app_16">No. 16</a>.
</p><p>
Migrating birds, whether for greater security from eagles, hawks, and
other enemies, or for some unknown reason, perform a great part of their
annual journeys by night; and it is observed in the Alps that they follow
the high roads in their passage across the mountains. This is partly
because the food in search of which they must sometimes descend is principally
found near the roads. It is, however, not altogether for the sake
of consorting with man, or of profiting by his labors, that their line of flight
conforms to the paths he has traced, but rather because the great roads are
carried through the natural depressions in the chain, and hence the birds
can cross the summit by these routes without rising to a height where at
the seasons of migration the cold would be excessive.
</p><p>
The instinct which guides migratory birds in their course is not in all
cases infallible, and it seems to be confounded by changes in the condition
of the surface. I am familiar with a village in New England, at the junction
of two valleys, each drained by a mill stream, where the flocks of wild
geese which formerly passed, every spring and autumn, were very frequently
lost, as it was popularly phrased, and I have often heard their screams in
the night as they flew wildly about in perplexity as to the proper course.
Perhaps the village lights embarrassed them, or perhaps the constant
changes in the face of the country, from the clearings then going on,
introduced into the landscape features not according with the ideal map
handed down in the anserine family, and thus deranged its traditional
geography.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_81_81" id="Footnote_81_81"></a><a href="#FNanchor_81_81"><span class="label">[81]</span></a> The cappercailzie, or tj&auml;der, as he is called in Sweden, is a bird of
singular habits, and seems to want some of the protective instincts which
secure most other wild birds from destruction. The younger L&aelig;stadius
frequently notices the tj&auml;der, in his very remarkable account of the Swedish
Laplanders&mdash;a work wholly unsurpassed as a genial picture of semi-barbarian
life, and not inferior in minuteness of detail to Schlatter's
description of the manners of the Nogai Tartars, or even to Lane's admirable
and exhaustive work on the Modern Egyptians. The tj&auml;der, though
not a bird of passage, is migratory, or rather wandering in domicile, and
appears to undertake very purposeless and absurd journeys. "When he
flits," says L&aelig;stadius, "he follows a straight course, and sometimes pursues
it quite out of the country. It is said that, in foggy weather, he sometimes
flies out to sea, and, when tired, falls into the water and is drowned. It is
accordingly observed that, when he flies westwardly, toward the mountains,
he soon comes back again; but when he takes an eastwardly course,
he returns no more, and for a long time is very scarce in Lapland. From
this it would seem that he turns back from the bald mountains, when he
discovers that he has strayed from his proper home, the wood; but when
he finds himself over the Baltic, where he cannot alight to rest and collect
himself, he flies on until he is exhausted and falls into the sea."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Petrus

watching for the waste of the caboose. "While the four great fleets,
English, French, Turkish, and Egyptian, were lying in the Bosphorus, in
the summer and autumn of 1853, a young lady of my family called my
attention to the fact that the gulls were far more numerous about the ships
of one of the fleets than about the others. This was verified by repeated
observation, and the difference was owing no doubt to the greater abundance
of the refuse from the cookrooms of the naval squadron most
frequented by the birds. Persons acquainted with the economy of the
navies of the states in question, will be able to conjecture which fleet was
most favored with these delicate attentions.</p></div>

foreign countries, but I can testify to one such case. A stork, which had
nested near one of the palaces on the Bosphorus, had, by some accident,
injured a wing, and was unable to join his follows when they commenced
their winter migration to the banks of the Nile. Before he was able to fly
again, he was caught, and the flag of the nation to which the palace
belonged was tied to his leg, so that he was easily identified at a considerable
distance. As his wing grow stronger, he made several unsatisfactory
experiments at flight, and at last, by a vigorous effort, succeeded
in reaching a passing ship bound southward, and perched himself on a
topsail yard. I happened to witness this movement, and observed him
quietly maintaining his position as long as I could discern him with a spyglass.
I suppose he finished the voyage, for he certainly did not return to
the palace.</p></div>

How various are the sources of happiness! Think of a learned German

attack the tuber of the potato. Some of them, especially one or two species
employed by anglers as bait, if natives of the woods, are at least rare
in shaded grounds, but multiply very rapidly after the soil is brought
under cultivation. Forty or fifty years ago they were so scarce in the
newer parts of New England, that the rustic fishermen of every village
kept secret the few places where they were to be found in their neighborhood,
as a professional mystery, but at present one can hardly turn over a
shovelful of rich moist soil anywhere, without unearthing several of them.
A very intelligent lady, born in the woods of Northern New England, told
me that, in her childhood, these worms were almost unknown in that
region, though anxiously sought for by the anglers, but that they increased
as the country was cleared, and at last became so numerous in some places,
that the water of springs, and even of shallow wells, which had formerly
been excellent, was rendered undrinkable by the quantity of dead worms
that fell into them. The increase of the robin and other small birds which
follow the settler when he has prepared a suitable home for them, at last
checked the excessive multiplication of the worms, and abated the nuisance.</p></div>

rarely, if ever, gathered in sufficient quantities to possess any geographical
importance by their mere mass; but the decayed exuvi&aelig; of even the
smaller and humbler forms of life are sometimes abundant enough to
exercise a perceptible influence on soil and atmosphere. "The plain of
Cumana," says Humboldt, "presents a remarkable phenomenon, after
heavy rains. The moistened earth, when heated by the rays of the sun,
diffuses the musky odor common in the torrid zone to animals of very
different classes, to the jaguar, the small species of tiger cat, the cabia&iuml;,
the gallinazo vulture, the crocodile, the viper, and the rattlesnake. The
gaseous emanations, the vehicles of this aroma, appear to be disengaged in
proportion as the soil, which contains the remains of an innumerable multitude
of reptiles, worms, and insects, begins to be impregnated with
water. Wherever we stir the earth, we are struck with the mass of
organic substances which in turn are developed and become transformed
or decomposed. Nature in these climes seems more active, more prolific,
and so to speak, more prodigal of life."</p></div>

observer I am happy to have frequent occasion to bear testimony, had
noticed that vegetation was necessary to maintain the purity of water in
artificial reservoirs, though he mistook the rationale of its influence, which
he ascribed to the elemental "salt" supposed by him to play an important
part in all the operations of nature. In his treatise upon Waters and
Fountains, p. 174, of the reprint of 1844, he says: "And in special, thou
shalt note one point, the which is understood of few: that is to say, that
the leaves of the trees which fall upon the parterre, and the herbs growing
beneath, and singularly the fruits, if any there be upon the trees, being
decayed, the waters of the parterre shall draw unto them the salt of the
said fruits, leaves, and herbs, the which shall greatly better the water of
thy fountains, and hinder the putrefaction thereof."</p></div>

years, and they may, under peculiar circumstances, be almost indefinitely
prolonged. Dr. Dwight mentions the following remarkable case of
this sort, which may be new to many readers: "While I was here [at
Williamstown, Mass.], Dr. Fitch showed me an insect, about an inch in
length, of a brown color tinged with orange, with two antenn&aelig;, not unlike
a rosebug. This insect came out of a tea table, made of the boards of an
apple tree." Dr. Dwight examined the table, and found the "cavity
whence the insect had emerged into the light," to be "about two inches
in length, nearly horizontal, and inclining upward very little, except at the
mouth. Between the hole, and the outside of the leaf of the table, there
were forty grains of the wood." It was supposed that the sawyer and the
cabinet maker must have removed at least thirteen grains more, and the

forms of animal life that are numerous in the native woods, and their
range is, of course, limited by the extent of the waters. The great abundance
of the trout, and of other more or less allied genera in the lakes of
Lapland, seems to be due to the supply of food provided for them by the
swarms of insects which in the larva state inhabit the waters, or, in other
stages of their life, are accidentally swept into them. All travellers in the
north of Europe speak of the gnat and the mosquito as very serious drawbacks
upon the enjoyments of the summer tourist, who visits the head of
the Gulf of Bothnia to see the midnight sun, and the brothers L&aelig;stadius
regard them as one of the great plagues of sub-Arctic life. "The persecutions
of these insects," says Lars Levi L&aelig;stadius [<i>Culex pipiens</i>, <i>Culex reptans</i>,
and <i>Culex pulicaris</i>], "leave not a moment's peace, by day or night,
to any living creature. Not only man, but cattle, and even birds and wild
beasts, suffer intolerably from their bite." He adds in a note, "I will not
affirm that they have ever devoured a living man, but many young cattle,
such as lambs and calves, have been worried out of their lives by them.
All the people of Lapland declare that young birds are killed by them, and
this is not improbable, for birds are scarce after seasons when the midge,
the gnat, and the mosquito are numerous."&mdash;<i>Om Uppodlingar i Lappmarken</i>,

to their young, I watched their proceedings, and found every day lying
near the tower numbers of dead or dying slowworms, and, in a few cases,
small lizards, which had, in every instance, lost about two inches of the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_98_98" id="Footnote_98_98"></a><a href="#FNanchor_98_98"><span class="label">[98]</span></a> From the narrative of Ohther, introduced by King Alfred into his
translation of Orosius, it is clear that the Northmen pursued the whale
fishery in the ninth century, and it appears, both from the poem called
The Whale, in the Codex Exoniensis, and from the dialogue with the fisherman
in the Colloquies of Aelfric, that the Anglo-Saxons followed this
dangerous chase at a period not much later. I am not aware of any evidence
to show that any of the Latin nations engaged in this fishery until
a century or two afterward, though it may not be easy to disprove their
earlier participation in it. In medi&aelig;val literature, Latin and Romance,
very frequent mention is made of a species of vessel called in Latin, <i>baleneria</i>,
<i>balenerium</i>, <i>balenerius</i>, <i>balaneria</i>, etc.; in Catalan, <i>balener</i>; in French,
<i>balenier</i>; all of which words occur in many other forms. The most obvious
etymology of these words would suggest the meaning, <i>whaler</i>, <i>baleinier</i>;
but some have supposed that the name was descriptive of the great size
of the ships, and others have referred it to a different root. From the
fourteenth century, the word occurs oftener, perhaps, in old Catalan, than
in any other language; but Capmany does not notice the whale fishery as
one of the maritime pursuits of the very enterprising Catalan people, nor
do I find any of the products of the whale mentioned in the old Catalan
tariffs. The <i>whalebone</i> of the medi&aelig;val writers, which is described as very
white, is doubtless the ivory of the walrus or of the narwhale.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_99_99" id="Footnote_99_99"></a><a href="#FNanchor_99_99"><span class="label">[99]</span></a> In consequence of the great scarcity of the whale, the use of coal gas
for illumination, the substitution of other fatty and oleaginous substances,
such as lard, palm oil, and petroleum, for right-whale oil and spermaceti,
the whale fishery has rapidly fallen off within a few years. The great
supply of petroleum, which is much used for lubricating machinery as well
as for numerous other purposes, has produced a more perceptible effect on
the whale fishery than any other single circumstance. According to Bigelow,
<i>Les &Eacute;tats Unis en 1863</i>, p. 346, the American whaling fleet was
diminished by 29 in 1858, 57 in 1860, 94 in 1861, and 65 in 1862. The
present number of American ships employed in that fishery is 353.</p></div>

multiplication of fish, as well as of other animals, is a not unfrequent occurrence.
I shall have occasion to mention on a following page the extermination
of the fish in a Swedish river by a flood occasioned by the sudden
discharge of the waters of a pond. Williams, in his <i>History of Vermont</i>,
i, p. 149, quoted in Thompson's <i>Natural History of Vermont</i>, p. 142,
records a case of the increase of trout from an opposite cause. In a pond
formed by damming a small stream to obtain water power for a sawmill,
and covering one thousand acres of primitive forest, the increased supply
of food brought within reach of the fish multiplied them to that degree,
that, at the head of the pond, where, in the spring, they crowded together
in the brook which supplied it, they were taken by the hands at pleasure,
and swine caught them without difficulty. A single sweep of a small
scoopnet would bring up half a bushel, carts were filled with them as fast
as if picked up on dry land, and in the fishing season they were commonly
sold at a shilling (eightpence halfpenny, or about seventeen cents) a bushel.
The increase in the size of the trout was as remarkable as the multiplication
of their numbers.</p></div>

</p><p>
In the latter part of the eighteenth century, this fishery was most successfully
prosecuted by the Swedes, and in 1781, the town of Gottenburg
alone exported 136,649 barrels, each containing 1,200 herrings, making a
total of about 164,000,000; but so rapid was the exhaustion of the fish,
from this keen pursuit, that in 1799 it was found necessary to prohibit the
exportation of them altogether.&mdash;<i>Das Leben des Meeres</i>, p. 182.

In 1855, the British fisheries produced 900,000 barrels, or enough to
supply a fish to every human inhabitant of the globe.

On the shores of Long Island Sound, the white fish, a species of herring

is little creditable to modern civilization, and it is painful to reflect that it
becomes keener and more unsparing in proportion to the refinement of the

and the Turk, whom we call a barbarian, treats the dumb beast as gently
as a child. One cannot live many weeks in Turkey without witnessing
touching instances of the kindness of the people to the lower animals, and
I have found it very difficult to induce even the boys to catch lizards and
other reptiles for preservation as specimens. See <i>Appendix</i>, <a href="#app_19">No. 19</a>.

The fearless confidence in man, so generally manifested by wild animals
in newly discovered islands, ought to have inspired a gentler treatment of

of the European forest. This timidity, however, may easily be overcome.

important, as showing that the diminution of the fish in rivers exposed
to inundations is chiefly to be ascribed to the mechanical action of the
current, and not mainly, as some have supposed, to changes of temperature
occasioned by clearing. Our author states that, in 1796, a terrible inundation
was produced in the Indalself, which rises in the Storsj&ouml; in Jemtland,
by drawing off into it the waters of another lake near Ragunda. The flood
destroyed houses and fields; much earth was swept into the channel, and
the water made turbid and muddy; the salmon and the smaller fish forsook
the river altogether, and never returned. The banks of the river
have never regained their former solidity, and portions of their soil are
still continually falling into the water.&mdash;<i>Resa genom Sverge</i>, ii, p. 51.</p></div>

as more injurious to the growth of young trees, and, therefore, to the reproduction
of the forest, than almost any other destructive cause. "According
to Beatson's <i>Saint Helena</i>, introductory chapter, and Darwin's <i>Journal
of Researches in Geology and Natural History</i>, pp. 582, 583," says Emsmann,
in the notes to his translation of Foissac, p. 654, "it was the goats which
destroyed the beautiful forests that, three hundred and fifty years ago,
covered a continuous surface of not less than two thousand acres in the
interior of the island [of St. Helena], not to mention scattered groups of
trees. Darwin observes: 'During our stay at Valparaiso, I was most
positively assured that sandal wood formerly grew in abundance on the
island of Juan Fernandez, but that this tree had now become entirely
extinct there, having been extirpated by the goats which early navigators
had introduced. The neighboring islands, to which goats have not been
carried, still abound in sandal wood.'"
</p><p>
In the winter, the deer tribe, especially the great American moose
deer, subsists much on the buds and young sprouts of trees; yet&mdash;though
from the destruction of the wolves or from some not easily explained
cause, these latter animals have recently multiplied so rapidly in some
parts of North America, that, not long since, four hundred of them are
said to have been killed, in one season, on a territory in Maine not comprising
more than one hundred and fifty square miles&mdash;the wild browsing
quadrupeds are rarely, if ever, numerous enough in regions uninhabited
by man to produce any sensible effect on the condition of the forest. A
reason why they are less injurious than the goat to young trees may be
that they resort to this nutriment only in the winter, when the grasses and
shrubs are leafless or covered with snow, whereas the goat feeds upon buds
and young shoots principally in the season of growth. However this may
be, the natural law of consumption and supply keeps the forest growth,
and the wild animals which live on its products, in such a state of equilibrium
as to insure the indefinite continuance of both, and the perpetuity
of neither is endangered until man, who is above natural law, interferes
and destroys the balance.
</p><p>
When, however, deer are bred and protected in parks, they multiply
like domestic cattle, and become equally injurious to trees. "A few years
ago," says Clav&eacute;, "there were not less than two thousand deer of different
ages in the forest of Fontainebleau. For want of grass, they are driven to
the trees, and they do not spare them. * * It is calculated that the
browsing of these animals, and the consequent retardation of the growth
of the wood, diminishes the annual product of the forest to the amount
of two hundred thousand cubic feet per year, * * and besides this, the
trees thus mutilated are soon exhausted and die. The deer attack the
pines, too, tearing off the bark in long strips, or rubbing their heads
against them when shedding their horns; and sometimes, in groves of
more than a hundred hectares, not one pine is found uninjured by them."&mdash;<i>Revue
des Deux Mondes</i>, Mai, 1863, p. 157. See also <i>Appendix</i>, <a href="#app_21">No. 21</a>.
</p><p>
Beckstein computes that a park of 2,500 acres, containing 250 acres of
marsh, 250 of fields and meadows, and the remaining 2,000 of wood, may
keep 364 deer of different species, 47 wild boars, 200 hares, 100 rabbits,
and an indefinite number of pheasants. These animals would require, in
winter, 123,000 pounds of hay, and 22,000 pounds of potatoes, besides
what they would pick up themselves. The natural forest most thickly
peopled with wild animals would not, in temperate climates, contain, upon
the average, one tenth of these numbers to the same extent of surface.</p></div>

The increase in the price of wines, in consequence of the diminution of
the product from the grape disease, however, has brought even these ashes

twenty years ago lay utterly waste, now covered with fine vineyards. The

of North America, far from the habitations of man, are almost destitute of
animal life. Dr. Newberry, describing the vast forests of the yellow pine
of the West, <i>Pinus ponderosa</i>, remarks: "In the arid and desert regions
of the interior basin, we made whole days' marches in forests of yellow
pine, of which neither the monotony was broken by other forms of vegetation,
nor its stillness by the flutter of a bird or the hum of an insect."&mdash;<i>Pacific

The wild fruit and nut trees, the Canada plum, the cherries, the many
species of walnut, the butternut, the hazel, yield very little, frequently
nothing, so long as they grow in the woods; and it is only when the trees
around them are cut down, or when they grow in pastures, that they become
productive. The berries, too&mdash;the strawberry, the blackberry, the
raspberry, the whortleberry, scarcely bear fruit at all except in cleared
ground.

The North American Indians did not inhabit the interior of the forests.
Their settlements were upon the shores of rivers and lakes, and their
weapons and other relics are found only in the narrow open grounds
which they had burned over and cultivated, or in the margin of the woods
around their villages.

The rank forests of the tropics are as unproductive of human aliment as
the less luxuriant woods of the temperate zone. In Strain's unfortunate
expedition across the great American isthmus, where the journey lay
principally through thick woods, several of the party died of starvation,
and for many days the survivors were forced to subsist on the scantiest
supplies of unnutritious vegetables perhaps never before employed for
food by man. See the interesting account of that expedition in <i>Harper's
Magazine</i> for March, April, and May, 1855.
</p><p>
Clav&eacute;, as well as many earlier writers, supposes that primitive man derived
his nutriment from the spontaneous productions of the wood. "It
is to the forests," says he, "that man was first indebted for the means of
subsistence. Exposed alone, without defence, to the rigor of the seasons,
as well as to the attacks of animals stronger and swifter than himself, he
found in them his first shelter, drew from them his first weapons. In
the first period of humanity, they provided for all his wants: they furnished
him wood for warmth, fruits for food, garments to cover his nakedness,
arms for his defence."&mdash;<i>&Eacute;tudes sur l'&Eacute;conomie Foresti&egrave;re</i>, p. 13.
</p><p>
But the history of savage life, as far as it is known to us, presents man
in that condition as inhabiting only the borders of the forest and the open
grounds that skirt the waters and the woods, and as finding only there the
aliments which make up his daily bread.</p></div>

historical evidence on the subject, and I believe that remains of forest
vegetation are seldom or never found beneath the surface, even in the
<i>sloughs</i>, where the perpetual moisture would preserve such remains indefinitely.
The want of trees upon them has been ascribed to the occasional
long-continued droughts of summer, and the excessive humidity of the soil
in winter; but it is, in very many instances, certain that, by whatever
means the growth of forests upon them was first prevented or destroyed,
the trees have been since kept out of them only by the annual burning of
the grass, by grazing animals, or by cultivation. The groves and belts of
trees which are found upon the prairies, though their seedlings are occasionally
killed by drought, or by excess of moisture, extend themselves
rapidly over them when the seeds and shoots are protected against fire,
cattle, and the plough. The prairies, though of vast extent, must be considered
as a local, and, so far as our present knowledge extends, abnormal
exception to the law which clothes all suitable surfaces with forest; for
there are many parts of the United States&mdash;Ohio, for example&mdash;where the
physical conditions appear to be nearly identical with those of the States
lying farther west, but where there were comparatively few natural
meadows. The prairies were the proper feeding grounds of the bison,
and the vast number of those animals is connected, as cause or consequence,
with the existence of those vast pastures. The bison, indeed,
could not convert the forest into a pasture, but he would do much to prevent
the pasture from becoming a forest.
</p><p>
There is positive evidence that some of the American tribes possessed
large herds of domesticated bisons. See <span class="smcap">Humboldt</span>, <i>Ansichten der Natur</i>,
i, pp. 71-73. What authorizes us to affirm that this was simply the wild
bison reclaimed, and why may we not, with equal probability, believe that
the migratory prairie buffalo is the progeny of the domestic animal run wild?
</p><p>
There are, both on the prairies, as in Wisconsin, and in deep forests, as
in Ohio, extensive remains of a primitive people, who must have been
more numerous and more advanced in art than the present Indian tribes.
There can be no doubt that the woods where such earthworks are found
in Ohio were cleared by them, and that the vicinity of these fortresses or
temples was inhabited by a large population. Nothing forbids the supposition
that the prairies were cleared by the same or a similar people, and
that the growth of trees upon them has been prevented by fires and
grazing, while the restoration of the woods in Ohio may be due to the
abandonment of that region by its original inhabitants. The climatic conditions
unfavorable to the spontaneous growth of trees on the prairies may
be an effect of too extensive clearings, rather than a cause of the want of
woods. See <i>Appendix</i>, <a href="#app_22">No. 22</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_119_119" id="Footnote_119_119"></a><a href="#FNanchor_119_119"><span class="label">[119]</span></a> In many parts of the North American States, the first white settlers
found extensive tracts of thin woods, of a very park-like character, called
"oak openings," from the predominance of different species of that tree
upon them. These were the semi-artificial pasture grounds of the Indians,
brought into that state, and so kept, by partial clearing, and by the annual
burning of the grass. The object of this operation was to attract the deer
to the fresh herbage which sprang up after the fire. The oaks bore the
annual scorching, at least for a certain time; but if it had been indefinitely
continued, they would very probably have been destroyed at last. The
soil would have then been much in the prairie condition, and would have
needed nothing but grazing for a long succession of years to make the resemblance
perfect. That the annual fires alone occasioned the peculiar
character of the oak openings, is proved by the fact, that as soon as the
Indians had left the country, young trees of many species sprang up and
grew luxuriantly upon them. See a very interesting account of the oak
openings in <span class="smcap">Dwight</span>'s <i>Travels</i>, iv, pp. 58-63.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_120_120" id="Footnote_120_120"></a><a href="#FNanchor_120_120"><span class="label">[120]</span></a> The practice of burning over woodland, at once to clear and manure
the ground, is called in Swedish <i>svedjande</i>, a participial noun from the verb
<i>att svedja</i>, to burn over. Though used in Sweden as a preparation for
crops of rye or other grain, it is employed in Lapland more frequently to
secure an abundant growth of pasturage, which follows in two or three
years after the fire; and it is sometimes resorted to as a mode of driving
the Laplanders and their reindeer from the vicinity of the Swedish backwoodsman's
grass grounds and haystacks, to which they are dangerous
neighbors. The forest, indeed, rapidly recovers itself, but it is a generation
or more before the reindeer moss grows again. When the forest consists
of pine, <i>tall</i>, the ground, instead of being rendered fertile by this
process, becomes hopelessly barren, and for a long time afterward produces
nothing but weeds and briers.&mdash;<span class="smcap">L&aelig;stadius</span>, <i>Om Uppodlingar i Lappmarken</i>,
p. 15. See also <span class="smcap">Schubert</span>, <i>Resa i Sverge</i>, ii, p. 375.
</p><p>
In some parts of France this practice is so general that Clav&eacute; says: "In
the department of Ardennes it (<i>le sartage</i>) is the basis of agriculture. The
northern part of the department, comprising the arrondissements of Rocroi
and M&eacute;zi&egrave;res, is covered by steep wooded mountains with an argillaceous,
compact, moist and cold soil; it is furrowed by three valleys, or rather
three deep ravines, at the bottom of which roll the waters of the Meuse,
the Semoy, and the Sormonne, and villages show themselves wherever the
walls of the valleys retreat sufficiently from the rivers to give room to
establish them. Deprived of arable soil, since the nature of the ground
permits neither regular clearing nor cultivation, the peasant of the Ardennes,
by means of burning, obtains from the forest a subsistence which,
without this resource, would fail him. After the removal of the disposable
wood, he spreads over the soil the branches, twigs, briars, and heath, sets
fire to them in the dry weather of July and August, and sows in September
a crop of rye, which he covers by a light ploughing. Thus prepared,
the ground yields from seventeen to twenty bushels an acre, besides a ton
and a half or two tons of straw of the best quality for the manufacture of
straw hats."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Clav&eacute;</span>, <i>&Eacute;tudes sur l'&Eacute;conomie Foresti&egrave;re</i>, p. 21.
</p><p>
Clav&eacute; does not expressly condemn the <i>sartage</i>, which indeed seems the
only practicable method of obtaining crops from the soil he describes, but,
as we shall see hereafter, it is regarded by most writers as a highly pernicious
practice.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_121_121" id="Footnote_121_121"></a><a href="#FNanchor_121_121"><span class="label">[121]</span></a> The remarkable mounds and other earthworks constructed in the valley
of the Ohio and elsewhere in the territory of the United States, by a people
apparently more advanced in culture than the modern Indian, were overgrown
with a dense clothing of forest when first discovered by the whites.
But though the ground where they were erected must have been occupied
by a large population for a considerable length of time, and therefore entirely
cleared, the trees which grew upon the ancient fortresses and the
adjacent lands were not distinguishable in species, or even in dimensions and
character of growth, from the neighboring forests, where the soil seemed
never to have been disturbed. This apparent exception to the law of change
of crop in natural forest growth was ingeniously explained by General Harrison's
suggestion, that the lapse of time since the era of the mound
builders was so great as to have embraced several successive generations of
trees, and occasioned, by their rotation, a return to the original vegetation.
</p><p>
The successive changes in the spontaneous growth of the forest, as
proved by the character of the wood found in bogs, is not unfrequently
such as to suggest the theory of a considerable change of climate during
the human period. But the laws which govern the germination and
growth of forest trees must be further studied, and the primitive local
conditions of the sites where ancient woods lie buried must be better
ascertained, before this theory can be admitted upon the evidence in question.
In fact, the order of succession&mdash;for a rotation or alternation is not
yet proved&mdash;may move in opposite directions in different countries with
the same climate and at the same time. Thus in Denmark and in Holland
the spike-leaved firs have given place to the broad-leaved beech, while in
Northern Germany the process has been reversed, and evergreens have
supplanted the oaks and birches of deciduous foliage. The principal determining
cause seems to be the influence of light upon the germination of
the seeds and the growth of the young tree. In a forest of firs, for instance,
the distribution of the light and shade, to the influence of which
seeds and shoots are exposed, is by no means the same as in a wood of
beeches or of oaks, and hence the growth of different species will be
stimulated in the two forests. See <span class="smcap">Berg</span>, <i>Das Verdr&auml;ngen der Laubw&auml;lder

to employ for this purpose poles supporting sheaves of straw connected

tried in Lombardy on a large scale, with more perfect electrical conductors,
consisting of poles secured to the top of tall trees and provided
with a pointed wire entering the ground and reaching above the top of the
pole. It was at first thought that this apparatus, erected at numerous
points over an extent of several miles, was of some service as a protection
against hail, but this opinion was soon disputed, and does not appear to be
supported by well-ascertained facts. The question of a repetition of the

upon the constitution of the atmosphere. "Plants imbibe from the air
carbonic acid and other gaseous or volatile products exhaled by animals or
developed by the natural phenomena of decomposition. On the other
hand, the vegetable pours into the atmosphere oxygen, which is taken up
by animals and appropriated by them. The tree, by means of its leaves
and its young herbaceous twigs, presents a considerable surface for absorption
and evaporation; it abstracts the carbon of carbonic acid, and solidifies
it in wood, fecula, and a multitude of other compounds. The result is that
a forest withdraws from the air, by its great absorbent surface, much more
gas than meadows or cultivated fields, and exhales proportionally a considerably
greater quantity of oxygen. The influence of the forests on the
chemical composition of the atmosphere is, in a word, of the highest importance."&mdash;<i>Les

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_130_130" id="Footnote_130_130"></a><a href="#FNanchor_130_130"><span class="label">[130]</span></a> Composition, texture and color of soil are important elements to be
considered in estimating the effects of the removal of the forest upon its
thermoscopic action. "Experience has proved," says Becquerel, "that
when the soil is bared, it becomes more or less heated [by the rays of the
sun] according to the nature and the color of the particles which compose
it, and according to its humidity, and that, in the refrigeration resulting
from radiation, we must take into the account the conducting power of
those particles also. Other things being equal, silicious and calcareous
sands, compared in equal volumes with different argillaceous earths, with
calcareous powder or dust, with humus, with arable and with garden earth,
are the soils which least conduct heat. It is for this reason that sandy
ground, in summer, maintains a high temperature even during the night.
We may hence conclude that when a sandy soil is stripped of wood, the
local temperature will be raised. After the sands follow successively argillaceous,
arable, and garden ground, then humus, which occupies the
lowest rank. If we represent the power of calcareous sand to retain
heat by 100, we have, according to Schubler,
</p>

<p>
"The retentive power of humus, then, is but half as great as that of
calcareous sand. We will add that the power of retaining heat is proportional
to the density. It has also a relation to the magnitude of the particles.
It is for this reason that ground covered with silicious pebbles
cools more slowly than silicious sand, and that pebbly soils are best suited
to the cultivation of the vine, because they advance the ripening of the
grape more rapidly than chalky and clayey earths, which cool quickly.
Hence we see that in examining the calorific effects of clearing forests, it
is important to take into account the properties of the soil laid bare."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Becquerel</span>,

probably to be referred to the influence of the forest as a shelter against
cold winds. To supply the extraordinary demand for Italian iron occasioned
by the exclusion of English iron in the time of Napoleon I, the
furnaces of the valleys of Bergamo were stimulated to great activity.
"The ordinary production of charcoal not sufficing to feed the furnaces
and the forges, the woods were felled, the copses cut before their time, and
the whole economy of the forest was deranged. At Piazzatorre there was
such a devastation of the woods, and consequently such an increased
severity of climate, that maize no longer ripened. An association, formed

Similar ameliorations have been produced by plantations in Belgium.
In an interesting series of articles by Baude, entitled "Les Cotes de la
Manche," in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, I find this statement: "A spectator
placed on the famous bell tower of the cathedral of Antwerp, saw,
not long since, on the opposite side of the Schelde only a vast desert plain;
now he sees a forest, the limits of which are confounded with the horizon.
Let him enter within its shade. The supposed forest is but a system of
regular rows of trees, the oldest of which is not forty years of age. These
plantations have ameliorated the climate which had doomed to sterility the
soil where they are planted. While the tempest is violently agitating their
tops, the air a little below is still, and sands far more barren than the
plateau of La Hague have been transformed, under their protection, into
fertile fields."&mdash;<i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, January, 1859, p. 277.</p></div>

well as in warmer latitudes under special circumstances, the processes of
vegetation go on, seems to necessitate the supposition that all the manifestations
of vegetable life are attended with an evolution of heat. In the
United States, it is common to protect ice, in icehouses, by a covering of
straw, which naturally sometimes contains kernels of grain. These often
sprout, and even throw out roots and leaves to a considerable length, in a
temperature very little above the freezing point. Three or four years since,
I saw a lump of very clear and apparently solid ice, about eight inches long
by six thick, on which a kernel of grain had sprouted in an icehouse, and
sent half a dozen or more very slender roots into the pores of the ice and
through the whole length of the lump. The young plant must have thrown
out a considerable quantity of heat; for though the ice was, as I have said,
otherwise solid, the pores through which the roots passed were enlarged to
perhaps double the diameter of the fibres, but still not so much as to prevent

On the 14th of January, 1791, in a winter remarkable for its extreme
severity, he found the ground, on a plain open field where the snow had
been blown away, frozen to the depth of three feet and five inches; in
the woods where the snow was three feet deep, and where the soil had
frozen to the depth of six inches before the snow fell, the thermometer,
at six inches below the surface of the ground, stood at 39&deg;. In consequence
of the covering of the snow, therefore, the previously frozen ground had
been thawed and raised to seven degrees above the freezing point.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Williams's</span>

Bodies of fresh water, so large as not to be sensibly affected by local
influences of narrow reach or short duration, would afford climatic indications
well worthy of special observation. Lake Champlain, which forms
the boundary between the States of New York and Vermont, presents very
favorable conditions for this purpose. This lake, which drains a basin of
about 6,000 square miles, covers an area, excluding its islands, of about 500
square miles. It extends from lat. 43&deg; 30' to 45&deg; 20', in very nearly a
meridian line, has a mean width of four and a half miles, with an extreme
breadth, excluding bays almost land-locked, of thirteen miles. Its mean
depth is not well known. It is, however, 400 feet deep in some places,
and from 100 to 200 in many, and has few shoals or flats. The climate
is of such severity that it rarely fails to freeze completely over, and to be
safely crossed upon the ice, with heavy teams, for several weeks every
winter. <span class="smcap">Thompson</span> (<i>Vermont</i>, p. 14, and Appendix, p. 9) gives the following
table of the times of the complete closing and opening of the ice,
opposite Burlington, about the centre of the lake, and where it is ten
miles wide.

In 1847, although, at the point indicated, the ice broke up on the 23d
of April, it remained frozen much later at the North, and steamers were
not able to traverse the whole length of the lake until May 6th.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_156_156" id="Footnote_156_156"></a><a href="#FNanchor_156_156"><span class="label">[156]</span></a> We are not, indeed, to suppose that condensation of vapor and
evaporation of water are going on in the same stratum of air at the same
time, or, in other words, that vapor is condensed into raindrops, and raindrops
evaporated, under the same conditions; but rain formed in one
stratum, may fall through another, where vapor would not be condensed.
Two saturated strata of different temperatures may be brought into contact
in the higher regions, and discharge large raindrops, which, if not
divided by some obstruction, will reach the ground, though passing all
the time through strata which would vaporize them if they were in a state
of more minute division.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_157_157" id="Footnote_157_157"></a><a href="#FNanchor_157_157"><span class="label">[157]</span></a> It is perhaps too much to say that the influence of trees upon the
wind is strictly limited to the mechanical resistance of their trunks,
branches, and foliage. So far as the forest, by dead or by living action,
raises or lowers the temperature of the air within it, so far it creates
upward or downward currents in the atmosphere above it, and, consequently,
a flow of air toward or from itself. These air streams have a
certain, though doubtless a very small influence on the force and direction
of greater atmospheric movements.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_158_158" id="Footnote_158_158"></a><a href="#FNanchor_158_158"><span class="label">[158]</span></a> As a familiar illustration of the influence of the forest in checking
the movement of winds, I may mention the well-known fact, that the sensible
cold is never extreme in thick woods, where the motion of the air is
little felt. The lumbermen in Canada and the Northern United States
labor in the woods, without inconvenience, when the mercury stands
many degrees below the zero of Fahrenheit, while in the open grounds,
with only a moderate breeze, the same temperature is almost insupportable.
The engineers and firemen of locomotives, employed on railways
running through forests of any considerable extent, observe that, in very
cold weather, it is much easier to keep up the steam while the engine is
passing through the woods than in the open ground. As soon as the train
emerges from the shelter of the trees the steam gauge falls, and the stoker
is obliged to throw in a liberal supply of fuel to bring it up again.
</p><p>
Another less frequently noticed fact, due, no doubt, in a great measure
to the immobility of the air, is, that sounds are transmitted to incredible
distances in the unbroken forest. Many instances of this have fallen under
my own observation, and others, yet more striking, have been related to
me by credible and competent witnesses familiar with a more primitive
condition of the Anglo-American world. An acute observer of natural
phenomena, whose childhood and youth were spent in the interior of one
of the newer New England States, has often told me that when he established
his home in the forest, he always distinctly heard, in still weather,
the plash of horses' feet, when they forded a small brook nearly seven-eighths
of a mile from his house, though a portion of the wood that intervened
consisted of a ridge seventy or eighty feet higher than either the
house or the ford.
</p><p>
I have no doubt that, in such cases, the stillness of the air is the most
important element in the extraordinary transmissibility of sound; but it
must be admitted that the absence of the multiplied and confused noises,
which accompany human industry in countries thickly peopled by man,
contributes to the same result. We become, by habit, almost insensible to
the familiar and never-resting voices of civilization in cities and towns;
but the indistinguishable drone, which sometimes escapes even the ear of
him who listens for it, deadens and often quite obstructs the transmission
of sounds which would otherwise be clearly audible. An observer, who
wishes to appreciate that hum of civic life which he cannot analyze, will
find an excellent opportunity by placing himself on the hill of Capo di
Monte at Naples, in the line of prolongation of the street called Spaccanapoli.
</p><p>
It is probably to the stillness of which I have spoken, that we are to
ascribe the transmission of sound to great distances at sea in calm weather.
In June, 1853, I and my family were passengers on board a ship of war
bound up the &AElig;gean. On the evening of the 27th of that month, as we
were discussing, at the tea table, some observations of Humboldt on this
subject, the captain of the ship told us that he had once heard a single gun
at sea at the distance of ninety nautical miles. The nest morning, though
a light breeze had sprung up from the north, the sea was of glassy smoothness
when we went on deck. As we came up, an officer told us that he
had heard a gun at sunrise, and the conversation of the previous evening
suggested the inquiry whether it could have been fired from the combined
French and English fleet then lying at Beshika Bay. Upon examination
of our position we were found to have been, at sunrise, ninety sea miles
from that point. We continued beating up northward, and between sunrise
and twelve o'clock meridian of the 28th, we had made twelve miles
northing, reducing our distance from Beshika Bay to seventy-eight sea
miles. At noon we heard several guns so distinctly that we were able to
count the number. On the 29th we came up with the fleet, and learned
from an officer who came on board that a royal salute had been fired at
noon on the 28th, in honor of the day as the anniversary of the Queen of
England's coronation. The report at sunrise was evidently the morning
gun, those at noon the salute.
</p><p>
Such cases are rare, because the sea is seldom still, and the &#954;&#965;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;
&#7936;&#957;&#942;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#959;&#957;
&#947;&#941;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#945; rarely silent, over so great a space as ninety or even
seventy-eight nautical miles. I apply the epithet <i>silent</i> to &#947;&#941;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#945; advisedly.
I am convinced that &AElig;schylus meant the audible laugh of the
waves, which is indeed of <i>countless</i> multiplicity, not the visible smile of
the sea, which, belonging to the great expanse as one impersonation, is single,
though, like the human smile, made up of the play of many features.</p></div>

surfaces are endowed with the power of absorbing gases, vapors,
and also, no doubt, the various soluble bodies which are presented to them.
The inhalation of humidity is carried on by the leaves upon a large scale;

If this latter view is correct, the apparently refreshing effects of atmospheric
humidity upon vegetation must be ascribed to moisture absorbed by
the ground from the air and supplied to the roots. In some recent experiments
by Dr. Sachs, a porous flower-pot, with a plant growing in it, was
left unwatered until the earth was dry, and the plant began to languish.
The pot was then placed in a glass case containing air, which was kept
always saturated with humidity, but no water was supplied, and the leaves
of the plant were exposed to the open atmosphere. The soil in the flower
pot absorbed from the air moisture enough to revive the foliage, and keep
it a long time green, but not enough to promote development of new leaves.&mdash;Id.,

in diameter, as having yielded a barrel, or thirty-one and a half gallons
of sap in twenty-four hours, and another, the dimensions of which are not
stated, as having yielded one hundred and seventy-five gallons in the course
of the season. The <i>Cultivator</i>, an American agricultural journal, for June,
1842, states that twenty gallons of sap were drawn in eighteen hours from
a single maple, two and a half feet in diameter, in the town of Warner,
New Hampshire, and the truth of this account has been verified by personal
inquiry made in my behalf. This tree was of the original forest
growth, and had been left standing when the ground around it was cleared.
It was tapped only every other year, and then with six or eight incisions.
Dr. Williams (<i>History of Vermont</i>, i, p. 91) says: "A man much employed
in making maple sugar, found that, for twenty-one days together,
a maple tree discharged seven and a half gallons per day."
</p><p>
An intelligent correspondent, of much experience in the manufacture
of maple sugar, writes me that a second-growth maple, of about two feet
in diameter, standing in open ground, tapped with four incisions, has, for
several seasons, generally run eight gallons per day in fair weather. He
speaks of a very large tree, from which sixty gallons were drawn in the
course of a season, and of another, something more than three feet through,
which made forty-two pounds of wet sugar, and must have yielded not
less than one hundred and fifty gallons.</p></div>

till toward the close of the sugar season. As soon as they begin to swell,
the sap seems less sweet, and the sugar made from it is of a darker color,
and with less of the distinctive maple flavor."</p></div>

bit, boring to the depth of one and a half or two inches. In the smaller
trees, one incision only is made, two in those of eighteen inches in diameter,
and four in trees of larger size. Two 3/4-inch holes in a tree twenty-two
inches in diameter = 1/46 of the circumference, and 1/169 of the area
of section."
</p><p>
"Tapping does not check the growth, but does injure the quality of
the wood of maples. The wood of trees often tapped is lighter and less
dense than that of trees which have not been tapped, and gives less heat
in burning. No difference has been observed in the starting of the buds
of tapped and untapped trees."&mdash;<i>Same correspondent.</i></p></div>

for tapping on an acre at from thirty to fifty. "This," observes my correspondent,
"is correct with regard to the original growth, which is always
more or less intermixed with other trees; but in second growth, composed
of maples alone, the number greatly exceeds this. I have had the
maples on a quarter of an acre, which I thought about an average of
second-growth 'maple orchards,' counted. The number was found to be
fifty-two, of which thirty-two were ten inches or more in diameter, and,
of course, large enough to tap. This gives two hundred and eight trees
to the acre, one hundred and twenty-eight of which were of proper size
for tapping."

the United States in 1850 was 34,253,436 pounds; in 1860, it was 38,863,884
pounds, besides 1,944,594 gallons of molasses. The cane sugar made

tapped about noon with two incisions, was found the next morning to have
yielded sixteen gallons. Dr. Williams (<i>History of Vermont</i>, i, p. 91) says:
"A large birch, tapped in the spring, ran at the rate of five gallons an hour
when first tapped. Eight or nine days after, it was found to run at the
rate of about two and a half gallons an hour, and at the end of fifteen
days the discharge continued in nearly the same quantity. The sap continued

that it must have yielded as much as sixty barrels [1,890 gallons]."</p></div>

"is clear days, thawing fast in the daytime and freezing well at night,
with a gentle west or northwest wind; though we sometimes have clear,
fine, thawing days followed by frosty nights, without a good run of sap,
I have thought it probable that the irregular flow of sap on different days
in the same season is connected with the variation in atmospheric pressure;
for the atmospheric conditions above mentioned as those most favorable
to a free flow of sap are also those in which the barometer usually indicates
pressure considerably above the mean. With a south or southeast
wind, and in lowering weather, which causes a fall in the barometer, the
flow generally ceases, though the sap sometimes runs till after the beginning
of the storm. With a <i>gentle</i> wind, south of west, maples sometimes
run all night. When this occurs, it is oftenest shortly before a storm.
Last spring, the sap of a sugar orchard in a neighboring town flowed the
greater part of the time for two days and two nights successively, and did
not cease till after the commencement of a rain storm."
</p><p>
The cessation of the flow of sap at night is perhaps in part to be ascribed
to the nocturnal frost, which checks the melting of the snow, of
course diminishing the supply of moisture in the ground, and sometimes
congeals the strata from which the rootlets suck in water. From the facts
already mentioned, however, and from other well-known circumstances&mdash;such,
for example, as the more liberal flow of sap from incisions on the
south side of the trunk&mdash;it is evident that the withdrawal of the stimulating
influences of the sun's light and heat is the principal cause of the
suspension of the circulation in the night.</p></div>

quantity of moisture abstracted by forest vegetation from the earth and the
air, by ascertaining, as nearly as possible, the quantity of wood on a given
area, the proportion of assimilable matter contained in the fluids of the
tree at different seasons of the year, the ages of the trees respectively, and
the quantity of leaf and seed annually shed by them. The results would,
indeed, be very vague, but they might serve to check or confirm estimates
arrived at by other processes. The following facts are items too loose
perhaps to be employed as elements in such a computation.
</p><p>
Dr. Williams, who wrote when the woods of Northern New England
were generally in their primitive condition, states the number of trees growing
on an acre at from one hundred and fifty to six hundred and fifty,
according to their size and the quality of the soil; the quantity of wood,
at from fifty to two hundred cords, or from 238 to 952 cubic yards, but
adds that on land covered with pines, the quantity of wood would be much
greater. Whether he means to give the entire solid contents of the tree,
or, as is usual in ordinary estimates in New England, the marketable wood
only, the trunks and larger branches, does not appear. Next to the pine,
the maple would probably yield a larger amount to a given area than any
of the other trees mentioned by Dr. Williams, but mixed wood, in general,
measures most. In a good deal of observation on this subject, the largest
quantity of marketable wood I have ever known cut on an acre of virgin
forest was one hundred and four cords, or 493 cubic yards, and half that
amount is considered a very fair yield. The smaller trees, branches, and
twigs would not increase the quantity more than twenty-five per cent.,
and if we add as much more for the roots, we should have a total of about
750 cubic yards. I think Dr. Williams's estimate too large, though it
would fall much below the product of the great trees of the Mississippi
Valley, of Oregon, and of California. It should be observed that these
measurements are those of the wood as it lies when 'corded' or piled up
for market, and exceed the real solid contents by not less than fifteen per
cent.
</p><p>
"In a soil of medium quality," says Clav&eacute;, quoting the estimates of
Pfeil, for the climate of Prussia, "the volume of a hectare of pines twenty
years old, would exceed 80 cubic m&egrave;tres [42&frac12; cubic yards to the acre]; it
would amount to but 24 in a meagre soil. This tree attains its maximum
of mean growth at the age of seventy-five years. At that age, in the
sandy earth of Prussia, it produces annually about 5 cubic m&egrave;tres, with a
total volume of 311 cubic m&egrave;tres per hectare [166 cubic yards per acre].
After this age the volume increases, but the mean rate of growth diminishes.
At eighty years, for instance, the volume is 335 cubic m&egrave;tres, the
annual production 4 only. The beech reaches its maximum of annual
growth at one hundred and twenty years. It then has a total volume of
633 cubic m&egrave;tres to the hectare [335 cubic yards to the acre], and produces
5 cubic m&egrave;tres per year."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Clav&eacute;</span>, <i>&Eacute;tudes</i>, p. 151.
</p><p>
These measures, I believe, include the entire ligneous product of the
tree, exclusive of the roots, and express the actual solid contents. The
specific gravity of maple wood is stated to be 75. Maple sap yields sugar
at the rate of about one pound <i>wet</i> sugar to three gallons of sap, and wet
sugar is to dry sugar in about the proportion of nineteen to sixteen. Besides
the sugar, there is a small residuum of "sand," composed of phosphate
of lime, with a little silex, and it is certain that by the ordinary hasty
process of manufacture, a good deal of sugar is lost; for the drops, condensed
from the vapor of the boilers on the rafters of the rude sheds
where the sap is boiled, have a decidedly sweet taste.</p></div>

So there is no separate circulation of the two kinds of sap; and no crude

plants, go far to prove that water only circulates through vegetables, and
is again and again absorbed and transpired by organs appropriated to these
functions. Seeds, growing grasses, shrubs, or trees planted in proper earth,
moderately watered and covered with a glass bell or close frame of glass,
live for months and even years, with only the original store of air and
water. In one of Ward's early experiments, a spire of grass and a fern,
which sprang up in a corked bottle containing a little moist earth introduced
as a bed for a snail, lived and flourished for eighteen years without
a new supply of either fluid. In these boxes the plants grow till the enclosed
air is exhausted of the gaseous constituents of vegetation, and till
the water has yielded up the assimilable matter it held in solution, and dissolved
and supplied to the roots the nutriment contained in the earth in
which they are planted. After this, they continue for a long time in a
state of vegetable sleep, but if fresh air and water be introduced into the
cases, or the plants be transplanted into open ground, they rouse themselves
to renewed life, and grow vigorously, without appearing to have suffered
from their long imprisonment. The water transpired by the leaves
is partly absorbed by the earth directly from the air, partly condensed on
the glass, along which it trickles down to the earth, enters the roots again,
and thus continually repeats the circuit. See <i>Aus der Natur</i>, 21, B. S. 537.</p></div>

what proportions the dew is evaporated, and in what it is absorbed by the
earth, in actual nature, but there can be no doubt that the amount of water
taken up by the ground, both from vapor suspended in the air and from
dew, is large. The annual fall of dew in England is estimated at five
inches, but this quantity is much exceeded in many countries with a
clearer sky. "In many of our Algerian campaigns," says Babinet, "when
it was wished to punish the brigandage of the unsubdued tribes, it was impossible
to set their grain fields on fire until a late hour of the day; for
the plants were so wet with the night dew that it was necessary to wait
until the sun had dried them."&mdash;<i>&Eacute;tudes et Lectures</i>, ii, p. 212.</p></div>

square statute miles. This does not include the recently discovered tracts
of land in the vicinity of the poles, and allowing for yet undiscovered land
(which, however, can only exist in small quantity), if we assign 51,000,000

extent of surface occupied by the ocean."&mdash;Sir <span class="smcap">J. F. W. Herschel</span>, <i>Physical

</p><p>
It does not appear to which category Herschel assigns the inland seas
and the fresh-water lakes and rivers of the earth; and Mrs. Somerville,
who states that the "dry land occupies an area of 38,000,000 of square
miles," and that "the ocean covers nearly three fourths of the surface of
the globe," is equally silent on this point.&mdash;<i>Physical Geography</i>, fifth
edition, p. 30. On the following page, Mrs. Somerville, in a note, cites
Mr. Gardner as her authority, and says that, "according to his computation,
the extent of land is about 37,673,000 square British miles, independently
of Victoria Continent; and the sea occupies 110,849,000. Hence
the land is to the sea as 1 to 4 nearly." Sir John F. W. Herschel makes
the area of dry land and ocean together 197,000,000 square miles; Mrs.
Somerville, or rather Mr. Gardner, 148,522,000. I suppose Sir John
Herschel includes the islands in his aggregate of the "dry land," and the
inland waters under the general designation of the "ocean," and that Mrs.
Somerville excludes both.</p></div>

The conclusion arrived at by Noah Webster, in his very learned and
able paper on the supposed change in the temperature of winter, read before
the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1799, was as follows:
"From a careful comparison of these facts, it appears that the
weather, in modern winters, in the United States, is more inconstant than
when the earth was covered with woods, at the first settlement of Europeans
in the country; that the warm weather of autumn extends further
into the winter months, and the cold weather of winter and spring encroaches
upon the summer; that, the wind being more variable, snow is
less permanent, and perhaps the same remark may be applicable to the ice
of the rivers. These effects seem to result necessarily from the greater
quantity of heat accumulated in the earth in summer since the ground
has been cleared of wood and exposed to the rays of the sun, and to the
greater depth of frost in the earth in winter by the exposure of its uncovered
surface to the cold atmosphere."&mdash;<i>Collection of Papers by</i> <span class="smcap">Noah

remote period. In Sandys's time, 1611, there were no woods in the island,
and it produced little cotton. He describes it as "a country altogether

Egypt is by no means established. I have heard it disputed on the spot
by intelligent Franks, whose residence in that country began before the
plantations of Mehemet Aali and Ibrahim Pacha, and I have been assured
by them that meteorological observations, made at Alexandria about the
beginning of this century, show an annual fall of rain as great as is usual
at this day. The mere fact, that it did not rain during the French occupation,
is not conclusive. Having experienced a gentle shower of nearly
twenty-four hours' duration in Upper Egypt, I inquired of the local governor
in relation to the frequency of this phenomenon, and was told by
him that not a drop of rain had fallen at that point for more than two
years previous.
</p><p>
The belief in the increase of rain in Egypt rests almost entirely on the
observations of Marshal Marmont, and the evidence collected by him in
1836. His conclusions have been disputed, if not confuted, by Jomard
and others, and are probably erroneous. See, <span class="smcap">Foissac</span>, <i>M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie</i>, German
translation, pp. 634-639.
</p><p>
It certainly sometimes rains briskly at Cairo, but evaporation is exceedingly
rapid in Egypt&mdash;as any one, who ever saw a Fellah woman wash a
napkin in the Nile, and dry it by shaking it a few moments in the air, can
testify; and a heap of grain, wet a few inches below the surface, would
probably dry again without injury. At any rate, the Egyptian Government
often has vast quantities of wheat stored at Boulak, in uncovered
yards through the winter, though it must be admitted that the slovenliness
and want of foresight in Oriental life, public and private, are such that we
cannot infer the safety of any practice followed in the East, merely from
its long continuance.
</p><p>
Grain, however, may be long kept in the open air in climates much
less dry than that of Egypt, without injury, except to the superficial
layers; for moisture does not penetrate to a great depth in a heap of grain
once well dried, and kept well aired. When Louis IX was making his
preparations for his campaign in the East, he had large quantities of wine
and grain purchased in the Island of Cyprus, and stored up, for two years,
to await his arrival. "When we were come to Cyprus," says Joinville,
<i>Histoire de Saint Louis</i>, &sect;&sect; 72, 73, "we found there greate foison of the
Kynge's purveyance. * * The wheate and the barley they had piled
up in greate heapes in the feeldes, and to looke vpon, they were like vnto
mountaynes; for the raine, the whyche hadde beaten vpon the wheate now
a longe whyle, had made it to sproute on the toppe, so that it seemed as
greene grasse. And whanne they were mynded to carrie it to Egypte,
they brake that sod of greene herbe, and dyd finde under the same the
wheate and the barley, as freshe as yf menne hadde but nowe thrashed it."</p></div>

Misopogon of the Emperor Julian, showing that, in the fourth century, the
Seine&mdash;the level of which now varies to the extent of thirty feet between
extreme high and extreme low water mark&mdash;was almost wholly exempt
from inundations, and flowed with a uniform current through the whole
year. "Ego olim eram in hibernis apud caram Lutetiam, [sic] enim Galli
Parisiorum oppidum appellant, qu&aelig; insula est non magna, in fluvio sita, qui
eam omni ex parte eingit. Pontes sublicii utrinque ad eam ferunt, rar&ograve;que

Travaux Publics dans leur Rapports avec l'Agriculture</i>, p. 361, note.

As Julian was six years in Gaul, and his principal residence was at
Paris, his testimony as to the habitual condition of the Seine, at a period
when the provinces where its sources originate were well wooded, is very
valuable.</p></div>

kind, were to be allowed to graze in thick woods, not in thin woods; in
woods, no kind of cattle without the owner's consent. Sticks and branches
might be gathered by any Hebrew, but not cut. * * * Woods might be

have occasioned an immense consumption of lumber in the Middle Ages,
and the centuries immediately succeeding those commonly embraced in
that designation. The marine construction of that period employed larger
timbers than the modern naval architecture of most commercial countries,
but apparently without a proportional increase of strength. The old
modes of ship building have been, to a considerable extent, handed down
to the present day in the Mediterranean, and an American or an Englishman
looks with astonishment at the huge beams and thick planks so often
employed in the construction of very small vessels navigating that sea.
According to Hummel, the desolation of the Karst, the high plateau lying
north of Trieste, now one of the most parched and barren districts in
Europe, is owing to the felling of its woods to build the navies of Venice.
"Where the miserable peasant of the Karst now sees nothing but bare
rock swept and scoured by the raging Bora, the fury of this wind was

passage, and from another on page 397 of the same volume, that, though
sea coal was largely exported to the Continent, it had not yet come into general
use in England. It is a question of much interest, when coal was first
employed in England for fuel. I can find no evidence that it was used as a
combustible until more than a century after the Norman conquest. It has
been said that it was known to the Anglo-Saxon population, but I am acquainted
with no passage in the literature of that people which proves
this. The dictionaries explain the Anglo-Saxon word <i>gr&aelig;fa</i> by sea coal.
I have met with this word in no Anglo-Saxon work, except in the <i>Chronicle</i>,
<span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 852, from a manuscript certainly not older than the twelfth century,
and in that passage it may as probably mean peat as coal, and quite
as probably something else as either. Coal is not mentioned in King Alfred's
Bede, in Glanville, or in Robert of Gloucester, though all these
writers speak of jet as found in England, and are full in their enumeration
of the mineral products of the island.
</p><p>
England was anciently remarkable for its forests, but C&aelig;sar says it
wanted the <i>fagus</i> and the <i>abies</i>. There can be no doubt that <i>fagus</i> means
the beech, which, as the remains in the Danish peat mosses show, is a tree
of late introduction into Denmark, where it succeeded the fir, a tree not now
native to that country. The succession of forest crops seems to have been
the same in England; for Harrison, p. 359, speaks of the "great store of
firre" found lying "at their whole lengths" in the "fens and marises"
of Lancashire and other counties, where not even bushes grew in his time.
We cannot be sure what species of evergreen C&aelig;sar intended by <i>abies</i>.
The popular designations of spike-leaved trees are always more vague and
uncertain in their application than those of broad-leaved trees. <i>Pinus</i>,
<i>pine</i>, has been very loosely employed even in botanical nomenclature, and
<i>Kiefer</i>, <i>Fichte</i>, and <i>Tanne</i> are often confounded in German.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rossm&auml;ssler</span>,
<i>Der Wald</i>, pp. 256, 289, 324. If it were certain that the <i>abies</i> of C&aelig;sar
was the fir formerly and still found in peat mosses, and that he was right
in denying the existence of the beech in England in his time, the observation
would be very important, because it would fix a date at which the fir
had become extinct, and the beech had not yet appeared in the island.
</p><p>
The English oak, though strong and durable, was not considered generally
suitable for finer work in the sixteenth century. There were, however, exceptions. "Of all in Essex," observes <span class="smcap">Harrison</span>, <i>Holinshed</i>, i, p.
357, "that growing in Bardfield parke is the finest for ioiners craft: for
oftentimes haue I seene of their workes made of that oke so fine and faire,
as most of the wainescot that is brought hither out of Danske; for our
wainescot is not made in England. Yet diuerse haue assaied to deale
without [with our] okes to that end, but not with so good successe as
they haue hoped, bicause the ab or iuice will not so soone be remoued
and cleane drawne out, which some attribute to want of time in the salt
water."
</p><p>
This passage is also of interest as showing that soaking in salt water, as
a mode of seasoning, was practised in Harrison's time.
</p><p>
But the importation of wainscot, or boards for ceiling, panelling, and
otherwise finishing rooms, which was generally of oak, commenced three
centuries before the time of Harrison. On page 204 of the <i>Liber Albus</i>&mdash;a
book which could have been far more valuable if the editor had given us
the texts, with his learned notes, instead of a translation&mdash;mention is made
of "squared oak timber," brought in from the country by carts, and of
course of domestic growth, as free of city duty or octroi, and of "planks
of oak" coming in in the same way as paying one plank a cartload. But
in the chapter on the "Customs of Billyngesgate," pp. 208, 209, relating to
goods imported from foreign countries, a duty of one halfpenny is imposed
on every hundred of boards called "weynscotte," and of one penny
on every hundred of boards called "Rygholt." The editor explains
"Rygholt" as "wood of Riga." This was doubtless pine or fir. The
year in which these provisions were made does not appear, but they
belong to the reign of Henry III.</p></div>

terrible inundations of 1857, the Emperor thus happily expressed himself:
"Before we seek the remedy for an evil, we inquire into its cause.
Whence come the sudden floods of our rivers? From the water which
falls on the mountains, not from that which falls on the plains. The
waters which fall on our fields produce but few rivulets, but those which
fall on our roofs and are collected in the gutters, form small streams at
once. Now, the roofs are mountains&mdash;the gutters are valleys."
</p><p>
"To continue the comparison," observes D'H&eacute;ricourt, "roofs are
smooth and impermeable, and the rain water pours rapidly off from their
surfaces; but this rapidity of flow would be greatly diminished if the roofs
were carpeted with mosses and grasses; more still, if they were covered
with dry leaves, little shrubs, strewn branches, and other impediments&mdash;in
short, if they were wooded."&mdash;<i>Annales Foresti&egrave;res, D&eacute;c.</i>, 1857, p. 311.</p></div>

the rain water filters down along the stakes, and, in certain cases, as

fertilizing effects of the slime deposited by the inundations of the Nile;
for in that climate a liberal supply of water would produce good crops on
almost any ordinary sand, while, without water, the richest soil would
yield nothing. The sediment deposited annually is but a very small fraction
of an inch in thickness. It is alleged that in quantity it would be
hardly sufficient for a good top dressing, and that in quality it is not chemically
distinguishable from the soil inches or feet below the surface. But
to deny, as some writers have done, that the slime has any fertilizing properties
at all, is as great an error as the opposite one of ascribing all the
agricultural wealth of Egypt to that single cause of productiveness. Fine
soils deposited by water are almost uniformly rich in all climates; those
brought down by rivers, carried out into salt water, and then returned
again by the tide, seem to be more permanently fertile than any others.
The polders of the Netherland coast are of this character, and the meadows
in Lincolnshire, which have been covered with slime by <i>warping</i>, as it is
called, or admitting water over them at high tide, are remarkably productive.

Both authors agree that the preservation of the forests in France is
practicable only by their transfer to the state, which alone can protect
them and secure their proper treatment. It is much to be feared that
even this measure would be inadequate to save the forests of the American
Union. There is little respect for public property in America, and the
Federal Government, certainly, would not be the proper agent of the
nation for this purpose. It proved itself unable to protect the live-oak
woods of Florida, which were intended to be preserved for the use of the
navy, and it more than once paid contractors a high price for timber stolen
from its own forests. The authorities of the individual States might be
more efficient.</p></div>

The recent change in the character of the Mella&mdash;a river anciently so
remarkable for the gentleness of its current that it was specially noticed
by Catullus as flowing <i>molli flumine</i>&mdash;deserves more than a passing
remark. This river rises in the mountain chain east of Lake Iseo, and
traversing the district of Brescia, empties into the Oglio after a course of
about seventy miles. The iron works in the upper valley of the Mella had
long created a considerable demand for wood, but their operations were
not so extensive as to occasion any very sudden or general destruction of
the forests, and the only evil experienced from the clearings was the gradual
diminution of the volume of the river. Within the last twenty years,
the superior quality of the arms manufactured at Brescia has greatly enlarged
the sale of them, and very naturally stimulated the activity of both
the forges and of the colliers who supply them, and the hillsides have been
rapidly stripped of their timber. Up to 1850, no destructive inundation
of the Mella had been recorded. Buildings in great numbers had been
erected upon its margin, and its valley was conspicuous for its rural
beauty and its fertility. But when the denudation of the mountains had
reached a certain point, avenging nature began the work of retribution.
In the spring and summer of 1850 several new torrents were suddenly
formed in the upper tributary valleys, and on the 14th and 15th of August
in that year, a fall of rain, not heavier than had been often experienced,
produced a flood which not only inundated much ground never before
overflowed, but destroyed a great number of bridges, dams, factories, and
other valuable structures, and, what was a far more serious evil, swept
off from the rocks an incredible extent of soil, and converted one of the
most beautiful valleys of the Italian Alps into a ravine almost as bare and
as barren as the savagest gorge of Southern France. The pecuniary
damage was estimated at many millions of francs, and the violence of the
catastrophe was deemed so extraordinary, even in a country subject to
similar visitations, that the sympathy excited for the sufferers produced, in
five months, voluntary contributions for their relief to the amount of
nearly $200,000&mdash;<i>Delle Inondazioni del Mella, etc., nella notte del 14 al 15
Agosto</i>, 1850.

The author of this remarkable pamphlet has chosen as a motto a passage
from the Vulgate translation of Job, which is interesting as showing
accurate observation of the action of the torrent: "Mons cadens definit,
et saxum transfertur de loco suo; lapides excavant aqu&aelig; et alluvione paullatim
terra consumitur."&mdash;<i>Job</i> xiv, 18, 19.

of the Tyrolese brooks is often raised much above the valleys through
which they flow. The bed of the Fersina is elevated high above the city
of Trient, which lies near it. The Villerbach flows at a much more
elevated level than that of the market place of Neumarkt and Vill, and
threatens to overwhelm both of them with its waters. The Talfer at
Botzen is at least even with the roofs of the adjacent town, if not above
them. The tower steeples of the villages of Schlanders, Kortsch, and
Laas, are lower than the surface of the Gadribach. The Saldurbach at
Schluderns menaces the far lower village with destruction, and the chief
town, Schwaz, is in similar danger from the Lahnbach."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Streffleur</span>,

and the water resulting from its dissolution and from the deluging rains
which fall in spring, and sometimes in the summer, being confined by
rocky walls on both sides, rises to a very great height, and of course
acquires an immense velocity and transporting power in its rapid descent
to its outlet from the mountain. In the winter of 1842&mdash;'3, the valley of
the Doveria, along which the Simplon road passes, was filled with solid
snowdrifts to the depth of a hundred feet above the carriage road, and the
sledge track by which passengers and the mails were carried ran at that
height.
</p><p>
Other things being equal, the transporting power of the water is greatest
where its flow is most rapid. This is usually in the direction of the
axis of the ravine. As the current pours out of the gorge and escapes
from the lateral confinement of its walls, it spreads and divides itself into
numerous smaller streams, which shoot out from the mouth of the valley,
as from a centre, in different directions, like the ribs of a fan from the
pivot, each carrying with it its quota of stones and gravel. The plain
below the point of issue from the mountain is rapidly raised by newly
formed torrents, the elevation depending on the inclination of the bed and
the form and weight of the matter transported. Every flood both increases
the height of this central point and extends the entire circumference of
the deposit. The stream retaining most nearly the original direction moves
with the greatest momentum, and consequently transports the solid matter
with which it is charged to the greatest distance.
</p><p>
The untravelled reader will comprehend this the better when he is informed
that the southern slope of the Alps generally rises suddenly out of
the plain, with no intervening hill to break the abruptness of the transition,
except those consisting of comparatively small heaps of its own debris
brought down by ancient glaciers or recent torrents. The torrents do not
wind down valleys gradually widening to the rivers or the sea, but leap at
once from the flanks of the mountains upon the plains below. This arrangement
of surfaces naturally facilitates the formation of vast deposits at
their points of emergence, and the centre of the accumulation in the case
of very small torrents is not unfrequently a hundred feet high, and sometimes
very much more.
</p><p>
Torrents and the rivers that receive them transport mountain debris to
almost incredible distances. Lorentz, in an official report on this subject,
as quoted by Marschand from the Memoirs of the Agricultural Society of
Lyons, says: "The felling of the woods produces torrents which cover
the cultivated soil with pebbles and fragments of rock, and they do not
confine their ravages to the vicinity of the mountains, but extend them
into the fertile fields of Provence and other departments, to the distance
of forty or fifty leagues."&mdash;<i>Entwaldung der Gebirge</i>, p. 17.</p></div>

Val Doveria, though here and there shattered, show in many places a
smoothness of face over a large vertical plane, at the height of hundreds
of feet above the bottom of the valley, which no known agency but glacier
ice is capable of producing, and of course they can have undergone no sensible
change at those points for a vast length of time. The beds of the
rivers which flow through those valleys suffer lateral displacement occasionally,
where there is room for the shifting of the channel; but if any elevation
or depression takes place in them, it is too slow to be perceptible
except in case of some merely temporary obstruction.</p></div>

down to the Po by its tributaries was, in general, comminuted to about the
same degree of fineness as the sands of its bed at their points of discharge.
In the case of the Trebbia, which rises high in the Apennines and empties
into the Po at Piacenza, it was otherwise, that river rolling pebbles and
coarse gravel into the channel of the principal stream. The banks of the
other affluents&mdash;excepting some of those which discharge their waters into
the great lakes&mdash;then either retained their woods, or had been so long
clear of them, that the torrents had removed most of the disintegrated
and loose rock in their upper basins. The valley of the Trebbia had been
recently cleared, and all the forces which tend to the degradation and
transportation of rock were in full activity.&mdash;<i>Notice sur les Rivi&egrave;res de la
Lombardie, Annales des Ponts et Chauss&eacute;es</i>, 1847, 1er s&eacute;mestre, p. 131.
</p><p>
Since the date of Lombardini's observations, many Alpine valleys have
been stripped of their woods. It would be interesting to know whether
any sensible change has been produced in the character or quantity of the
matter transported by them to the Po.</p></div>

of the water through them are less frequent, the height of the annual inundations
is increased. Many towns on the banks of the river, and of course
within the system of parallel embankments, were formerly secure from
flood by the height of the artificial mounds on which they were built; but
they have recently been obliged to construct ring dikes for their protection.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Baumgarten</span>,

a much larger proportion of their woods, the moderate annual floods
of the Po were occasioned by the melting of the snows, and, as appears by
a passage of Tasso quoted by Castellani (<i>Dell' Influenza delle Selve</i>, i, p. 58,
note), they took place in May. The much more violent inundations of the
present century are due to rains, the waters of which are no longer retained
by a forest soil, but conveyed at once to the rivers&mdash;and they occur almost
uniformly in the autumn or late summer. Castellani, on the page just
quoted, says that even so late as about 1780, the Po required a heavy rain
of a week to overflow its banks, but that forty years later, it was sometimes
raised to full flood in a single day.</p></div>

A computation by a different method makes the deposits at the mouth

value of which is precisely ascertained; nor, for the purposes of the
present argument, is quantitative exactness important. I employ numerical
statements simply as a means of aiding the imagination to form a
general and certainly not extravagant idea of the extent of geographical
revolutions which man has done much to accelerate, if not, strictly speaking,
to produce.
</p><p>
There is an old proverb, <i>Dolus latet in generalibus</i>, and Arthur Young
is not the only public economist who has warned his readers against the
deceitfulness of round numbers. I think, on the contrary, that vastly
more error has been produced by the affectation of precision in cases where
precision is impossible. In all the great operations of terrestrial nature,
the elements are so numerous and so difficult of exact appreciation, that,
until the means of scientific observation and measurement are much more
perfected than they now are, we must content ourselves with general approximations.
I say <i>terrestrial</i> nature, because in cosmical movements we
have fewer elements to deal with, and may therefore arrive at much more
rigorous accuracy in determination of time and place than we can in fixing
and predicting the quantities and the epochs of variable natural phenomena
on the earth's surface.
</p><p>
The value of a high standard of accuracy in scientific observation can
hardly be overrated; but habits of rigorous exactness will never be formed
by an investigator who allows himself to trust implicitly to the numerical
precision of the results of a few experiments. The wonderful accuracy of
geodetic measurements in modern times is, in general, attained by taking
the mean of a great number of observations at every station, and this
final precision is but the mutual balance and compensation of numerous
errors.

Travellers are often misled by local habits in the use of what may be
called representative numbers, where a definite is put for an indefinite
quantity. A Greek, who wished to express the notion of a great, but undetermined
number, used "myriad, or ten thousand;" a Roman, "six
hundred;" an Oriental, "forty," or, at present, very commonly, "fifteen
thousand." Many a tourist has gravely repeated, as an ascertained fact,
the vague statement of the Arabs and the monks of Mount Sinai, that the
ascent from the convent of St. Catherine to the summit of Gebel Moosa
counts "fifteen thousand" steps, though the difference of level is barely
two thousand feet, and the "Forty" Thieves, the "forty" martyr monks
of the convent of El Arbain&mdash;not to speak of a similar use of this numeral
in more important cases&mdash;have often been understood as expressions of a
known number, when in fact they mean simply <i>many</i>. The number
"fifteen thousand" has found its way to Rome, and De Quincey seriously
informs us, on the authority of a lady who had been at much pains to
ascertain the <i>exact</i> truth, that, including closets large enough for a bed, the
Vatican contains fifteen thousand rooms. Any one who has observed the
vast dimensions of most of the apartments of that structure will admit that
we make a very small allowance of space when we assign a square rod,
sixteen and a half feet square, to each room upon the average. On an
acre, there might be one hundred and sixty such rooms, including partition
walls; and, to contain fifteen thousand of them, a building must
cover more than nine acres, and be ten stories high, or possess other
equivalent dimensions, which, as every traveller knows, many times exceeds
the truth.
</p><p>
That most entertaining writer, About, reduces the number of rooms in
the Vatican, but he compensates this reduction by increased dimensions,
for he uses the word <i>salle</i>, which cannot be applied to closets barely large
enough to contain a bed. According to him, there are in that "presbyt&egrave;re,"
as he irreverently calls it, twelve thousand large rooms [<i>salles</i>],
thirty courts, and three hundred staircases.&mdash;<i>Rome Contemporaire</i>, p. 68.

The pretended exactness of statistical tables is generally little better
than an imposture; and those founded not on direct estimation by competent
observers, but on the report of persons who have no particular interest
in knowing, but often have a motive for distorting, the truth&mdash;such as
census returns&mdash;are commonly to be regarded as but vague guesses at the
actual fact.
</p><p>
Fuller, who, for the combination of wit, wisdom, fancy, and personal
goodness, stands first in English literature, thus remarks on the pretentious
exactness of historical and statistical writers: "I approve the plain,

in matters of fact by the most authentic Historians. Yea, we may observe
that the Spirit of Truth itself, where <i>Numbers</i> and <i>Measures</i> are concerned,
in Times, Places, and Persons, useth the aforesaid Modifications, save in

the clearing of the ground, which, in consequence of a temporary diversion
of the waters, or from some other cause, has become rewooded, sometimes
renews the ravages of the torrent. Thus, on the left bank of the
Durance, a wooded declivity had been formed by the debris brought down
by torrents, which had extinguished themselves after having swept off
much of the superficial strata of the mountain of Morgon. "All this district
was covered with woods, which have now been thinned out and are
perishing from day to day; consequently, the torrents have recommenced
their devastations, and if the clearings continue, this declivity, now fertile,
will be ruined, like so many others."&mdash;Id., p. 155.</p></div>

Freshly quarried marble, and even granite, as well as most other

are porous enough to serve as filters for liquids, and much of that
of Upper Egypt and Nubia hisses audibly when thrown into water, from
the escape of the air forced out of it by hydrostatic pressure and the
capillary attraction of the pores for water. See <i>Appendix</i>, <a href="#app_29">No. 29</a>.</p></div>

thus describes it, in his essay on the formation of ice: "I know that the
stones of the mountains of Ardennes be harder than marble. Nevertheless,
the people of that country do not quarry the said stones in winter, for
that they be subject to frost; and many times the rocks have been seen to
fall without being cut, by means whereof many people have been killed,
when the said rocks were thawing." Palissy was ignorant of the expansion
of water in freezing&mdash;in fact he supposed that the mechanical force
exerted by freezing water was due to compression, not dilatation&mdash;and
therefore he ascribes to thawing alone effects resulting not less from congelation.
</p><p>
Various forces combine to produce the stone avalanches of the higher
Alps, the fall of which is one of the greatest dangers incurred by the adventurous
explorers of those regions&mdash;the direct action of the sun upon
the stone, the expansion of freezing water, and the loosening of masses
of rock by the thawing of the ice which supported them or held them
together.</p></div>

by the fact that, where the forest is wanting, the inhabitants of
localities exposed to snow slides often supply the place of the trees by
driving stakes through the snow into the ground, and thus checking its
propensity to slip. The woods themselves are sometimes thus protected
against avalanches originating on slopes above them, and as a further
security, small trees are cut down along the upper line of the forest, and
laid against the trunks of larger trees, transversely to the path of the
slide, to serve as a fence or dam to the motion of an incipient avalanche,
which may by this means be arrested before it acquires a destructive
velocity and force.</p></div>

</p><p>
The lumber trade at Quebec is still very large. According to a recent
article in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, that city exported, in 1860, 30,000,000
cubic feet of squared timber, and 400,000,000 square feet of "planches."
The thickness of the boards is not stated, but I believe they are generally
cut an inch and a quarter thick for the Quebec trade, and as they shrink
somewhat in drying, we may estimate ten square for one cubic foot
of boards. This gives a total of 70,000,000 cubic feet. The specific
gravity of white pine is .554, and the weight of this quantity of lumber,
very little of which is thoroughly seasoned, would exceed a million of tons,
even supposing it to consist wholly of wood as light as pine. New Brunswick,
too, exports a large amount of lumber.</p></div>

Different woods vary greatly in combustibility, and even when their bark
is scarcely scorched, they are, partly in consequence of physiological character,
and partly from the greater or less depth at which their roots habitually
lie below the surface, very differently affected by running fires. The
white pine, <i>Pinus strobus</i>, as it is the most valuable, is also perhaps the
most delicate tree of the American forest, while its congener, the Northern
pitch pine, <i>Pinus rigida</i>, is less injured by fire than any other tree of that
country. I have heard experienced lumbermen maintain that the growth
of this pine was even accelerated by a fire brisk enough to destroy all
other trees, and I have myself seen it still flourishing after a conflagration
which had left not a green leaf but its own in the wood, and actually
throwing out fresh foliage, when the old had been quite burnt off and the
bark almost converted into charcoal. The wood of the pitch pine is of
comparatively little value for the joiner, but it is useful for very many purposes.
Its rapidity of growth in even poor soils, its hardihood, and its
abundant yield of resinous products, entitle it to much more consideration,
as a plantation tree, than it has hitherto received in Europe or America.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_247_247" id="Footnote_247_247"></a><a href="#FNanchor_247_247"><span class="label">[247]</span></a> Between fifty and sixty years ago, a steep mountain with which I am
very familiar, composed of metamorphic rock, and at that time covered
with a thick coating of soil and a dense primeval forest, was accidentally
burnt over. The fire took place in a very dry season, the slope of the
mountain was too rapid to retain much water, and the conflagration was
of an extraordinarily fierce character, consuming the wood almost entirely,
burning the leaves and combustible portion of the mould, and in many
places cracking and disintegrating the rock beneath. The rains of the following
autumn carried off much of the remaining soil, and the mountain
side was nearly bare of wood for two or three years afterward. At
length, a new crop of trees sprang up and grew vigorously, and the mountain
is now thickly covered again. But the depth of mould and earth is
too small to allow the trees to reach maturity. When they attain to the
diameter of about six inches, they uniformly die, and this they will no
doubt continue to do until the decay of leaves and wood on the surface,
and the decomposition of the subjacent rock, shall have formed, perhaps
hundreds of years hence, a stratum of soil thick enough to support a full-grown
forest.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_248_248" id="Footnote_248_248"></a><a href="#FNanchor_248_248"><span class="label">[248]</span></a> The growth of the white pine, on a good soil and in open ground, is
rather rapid until it reaches the diameter of a couple of feet, after which it
is much slower. The favorite habitat of this tree is light sandy earth. On
this soil, and in a dense wood, it requires a century to attain the diameter
of a yard. Emerson (<i>Trees of Massachusetts</i>, p. 65), says that a pine of this
species, near Paris, "thirty years planted, is eighty feet high, with a diameter
of three feet." He also states that ten white pines planted at Cambridge,
Massachusetts, in 1809 or 1810, exhibited, in the winter of 1841 and 1842,
an average of twenty inches diameter at the ground, the two largest
measuring, at the height of three feet, four feet eight inches in circumference;
and he mentions another pine growing in a rocky swamp, which,
at the age of thirty-two years, "gave seven feet in circumference at the
but, with a height of sixty-two feet six inches." This latter I suppose to
be a seedling, the others <i>transplanted</i> trees, which might have been some
years old when placed where they finally grew.
</p><p>
The following case came under my own observation: In 1824, a pine
tree, so small that a young lady, with the help of a lad, took it up from
the ground and carried it a quarter of a mile, was planted near a house
in a town in Vermont. It was occasionally watered, but received no
other special treatment. I measured this tree in 1860, and found it, at
four feet from the ground, and entirely above the spread of the roots, two
feet and four inches in diameter. It could not have been more than three
inches through when transplanted, and must have increased its diameter

in the dense woods. Dr. Williams found that none of the huge
pines, the age of which he ascertained, exceeded three hundred and fifty
or four hundred years, though he quotes a friend who thought he had
noticed trees considerably older. The oak lives longer than the pine, and
the hemlock spruce is perhaps equally long lived. A tree of this latter
species, cut within my knowledge in a thick wood, counted four hundred and
eighty-six, or, according to another observer, five hundred annual circles.
</p><p>
Great luxuriance of animal and vegetable production is not commonly
accompanied by long duration of the individual. The oldest men are not
found in the crowded city; and in the tropics, where life is prolific and
precocious, it is also short. The most ancient forest trees of which we
have accounts have not been those growing in thick woods, but isolated
specimens, with no taller neighbor to intercept the light and heat and air,
and no rival to share the nutriment afforded by the soil.
</p><p>
The more rapid growth and greater dimensions of trees standing near
the boundary of the forest, are matters of familiar observation. "Long
experience has shown that trees growing on the confines of the wood may
be cut at sixty years of age as advantageously as others of the same
species, reared in the depth of the forest, at a hundred and twenty. We
have often remarked, in our Alps, that the trunk of trees upon the border
of a grove is most developed or enlarged upon the outer or open side,
where the branches extend themselves farthest, while the concentric
circles of growth are most uniform in those entirely surrounded by other
trees, or standing entirely alone."&mdash;A. and G. <span class="smcap">Villa</span>, <i>Necessit&agrave; dei Boschi</i>,

maintain that, in consequence of direct obstruction and frictional resistance
to the flow of the water of rivers along their banks, there is both an increased
rapidity of current and an elevation of the water in the middle of
the channel, so that a river presents always a convex surface. The lumbermen
deny this. They affirm that, while rivers are rising, the water is
highest in the middle of the channel, and tends to throw floating objects
shoreward; while they are falling, it is lowest in the middle, and floating
objects incline toward the centre. Logs, they say, rolled into the water
during the rise, are very apt to lodge on the banks, while those set afloat
during the falling of the waters keep in the current, and are carried
without hindrance to their destination.
</p><p>
Foresters and lumbermen, like sailors and other persons whose daily
occupations bring them into contact, and often, into conflict, with great
natural forces, have many peculiar opinions, not to say superstitions. In
one of these categories we must rank the universal belief of lumbermen,
that with a given head of water, and in a given number of hours, a sawmill
cuts more lumber by night than by day. Having been personally
interested in several sawmills, I have frequently conversed with sawyers
on this subject, and have always been assured by them that their uniform
experience established the fact that, other things being equal, the action
of the machinery of sawmills is more rapid by night than by day. I am
sorry&mdash;perhaps I ought to be ashamed&mdash;to say that my scepticism has
been too strong to allow me to avail myself of my opportunities of testing
this question by passing a night, watch in hand, counting the strokes of a
millsaw. More unprejudiced, and I must add, very intelligent and credible
persons have informed me that they have done so, and found the
report of the sawyers abundantly confirmed. A land surveyor, who was
also an experienced lumberman, sawyer, and machinist, a good mathematician
and an exact observer, has repeatedly told me, that he had very often
"timed" sawmills, and found the difference in favor of night work above
thirty per cent. <i>Sed qu&aelig;re.</i></p></div>

considerable extent of forest. After they retired, a survey of the damage was
had, and the report is still extant. The number of trees cut was found to
be 120,000, and as an account was kept of the numbers of each species of
tree, the document is of interest in the history of the forest, as showing
the relative proportions between the different trees which composed the
wood. See <span class="smcap">Vaupell</span>. <i>B&ouml;gens Indvandring</i>, p. 35, and <i>Notes</i>, p. 55.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_254_254" id="Footnote_254_254"></a><a href="#FNanchor_254_254"><span class="label">[254]</span></a> Since writing this paragraph, I have fallen upon&mdash;and that in a Spanish
author&mdash;one of those odd coincidences of thought which every man
of miscellaneous reading so often meets with. Antonio Ponz (<i>Viage de
Espa&ntilde;a</i>, i, pr&oacute;logo, p. lxiii), says: "Nor would this be so great an evil,
were not some of them declaimers against <i>trees</i>, thereby proclaiming themselves,
in some sort, enemies of the works of God, who gave us the leafy
abode of Paradise to dwell in, where we should be even now sojourning,
but for the first sin, which expelled us from it."
</p><p>
I do not know at what period the two Castiles were bared of their
woods, but the Spaniard's proverbial "hatred of a tree" is of long standing.
Herrera vigorously combats this foolish prejudice; and Ponz, in the
prologue to the ninth volume of his journey, says that many carried it so
far as wantonly to destroy the shade and ornamental trees planted by the
municipal authorities. "Trees," they contended, and still believe, "breed
birds, and birds eat up the grain." Our author argues against the supposition
of the "breeding of birds by trees," which, he says, is as absurd as
to believe that an elm tree can yield pears; and he charitably suggests that
the expression is, perhaps, a <i>mani&egrave;re de dire</i>, a popular phrase, signifying
simply that trees harbor birds.</p></div>

earlier period. "The revocation of the edict of Nantes and the dragonnades
occasioned the sale of the forests of the unhappy Protestants, who
fled to seek in foreign lands the liberty of conscience which was refused
to them in France. The forests were soon felled by the purchasers, and
the soil in part brought under cultivation."'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Becquerel</span>, <i>Des Climats, etc.</i>,

chase and of the English law, a "forest" is not necessarily a wood. Any
large extent of ground, withdrawn from cultivation, reserved for the
pleasures of the chase, and allowed to clothe itself with a spontaneous
growth, serving as what is technically called "cover" for wild animals,
is, in the dialects I have mentioned, a forest. When, therefore, the
Norman kings afforested the grounds referred to in the text, it is not
to be supposed that they planted them with trees, though the protection
afforded to them by the game laws would, if cattle had been kept out,
soon have converted them into real woods.</p></div>

Persons acquainted with the character and influence of the medi&aelig;val
clergy will hardly need to be informed that the ten thousand livres never
found their way to the royal exchequer. It was easy to prove to the
simple-minded king that, as the profits of sin were a monopoly of the
church, he ought not to derive advantage from the commission of a crime
by one of his subjects; and the priests were cunning enough both to secure
to themselves the amount of the fine, and to extort from Louis large additional
grants to carry out the purposes to which they devoted the money.
"And though the king did take the moneys," says the chronicler, "he put
them not into his treasury, but turned them into good works; for he
builded therewith the maison-Dieu of Pontoise, and endowed the same
with rents and lands; also the schools and the dormitory of the friars
preachers of Paris, and the monastery of the Minorite friars."</p></div>

idea of the vexatious and irritating nature of the game laws of France.
The officers of the chase went so far as to forbid the pulling up of thistles
and weeds, or the mowing of any unenclosed ground before St. John's day
[24th June], in order that the nests of game birds might not be disturbed.
It was unlawful to fence-in any grounds in the plains where royal residences
were situated; thorns were ordered to be planted in all fields of
wheat, barley, or oats, to prevent the use of ground nets for catching the
birds which consumed, or were believed to consume, the grain, and it was
forbidden to cut or pull stubble before the first of October, lest the partridge
and the quail might be deprived of their cover. For destroying the
eggs of the quail, a fine of one hundred livres was imposed for the first
offence, double that amount for the second, and for the third the culprit
was flogged and banished for five years to a distance of six leagues from
the forest.&mdash;<i>Histoire des Paysans</i>, ii, p. 202, text and notes.
</p><p>
Neither these severe penalties, nor any provisions devised by the ingenuity
of modern legislation, have been able effectually to repress poaching.
"The game laws," says Clav&eacute;, "have not delivered us from the poachers,
who kill twenty times as much game as the sportsmen. In the forest of
Fontainebleau, as in all those belonging to the state, poaching is a very
common and a very profitable offence. It is in vain that the gamekeepers
are on the alert night and day, they cannot prevent it. Those who follow
the trade begin by carefully studying the habits of the game. They will
lie motionless on the ground, by the roadside or in thickets, for whole
days, watching the paths most frequented by the animals," &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Revue des
Deux Mondes</i>, Mai, 1863, p. 160.
</p><p>
The writer adds many details on this subject, and it appears that, as
there are "beggars on horseback" in South America, there are poachers
in carriages in France.</p></div>

A similar wastefulness formerly prevailed in Russia, though not from

which stood a few scattered pines. <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>, and <i>Sempervivum tectorum</i>
in abundance, <i>Statice armeria</i>, <i>Ammone vernalis</i>, <i>Dianthus carthusianorum</i>,
with other sand plants, were growing there. I planted the hill
with a few birches, and all the plants I have mentioned completely disappeared,
though there were many naked spots of sand between the trees.
It should be added, however, that the hillock is more thickly wooded than
before. * * * It seems then that <i>Sempervivum tectorum</i>, &amp;c., will not
bear the neighborhood of the birch, though growing well near the <i>Pinus
sylvestris</i>. I have found the large red variety of <i>Agaricus deliciosus</i> only
among the roots of the pine; the greenish-blue <i>Agaricus deliciosus</i> among
alder roots, but not near any other tree. Birds have their partialities
among trees and shrubs. The <i>Silvi&aelig;</i> prefer the <i>Pinus Larix</i> to other trees.
In my garden this <i>Pinus</i> is never without them, but I never saw a bird
perch on <i>Thuja occidenialis</i> or <i>Juniperus sabina</i>, although the thick foliage
of these latter trees affords birds a better shelter than the loose leafage of
other trees. Not even a wren ever finds its way to one of them. Perhaps
the scent of the <i>Thuja</i> and the <i>Juniperus</i> is offensive to them. I have
spoiled one of my meadows by cutting away the bushes. It formerly bore
grass four feet high, because many umbelliferous plants, such as <i>Heracleum
spondylium</i>, <i>Spir&aelig;a ulmaria</i>, <i>Laserpitium latifolia</i>, &amp;c., grew in it. Under
the shelter of the bushes these plants ripened and bore seed, but they gradually
disappeared as the shrubs were extirpated, and the grass now does
not grow to the height of more than two feet, because it is no longer
obliged to keep pace with the umbellifera which flourished among it." See
a paper by J. G. <span class="smcap">B&uuml;ttner</span>, of Kurland, in <span class="smcap">Berghaus</span>' <i>Geographisches Jahrbuch</i>,
1852, No. 4, pp. 14, 15.

These facts are interesting as illustrating the multitude of often obscure
conditions upon which the life or vigorous growth of smaller organisms
depends. Particular species of truffles and of mushrooms are found associated
with particular trees, without being, as is popularly supposed, parasites
deriving their nutriment from the dying or dead roots of those trees.
The success of Rousseau's experiments seem decisive on this point, for he
obtains larger crops of truffles from ground covered with young seedling
oaks than from that filled with roots of old trees. See an article on Mont
Ventoux, by Charles Martins, in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, Avril, 1863,
p. 626.
</p><p>
It ought to be much more generally known than it is that most, if not,
all mushrooms, even of the species reputed poisonous, may be rendered
harmless and healthful as food by soaking them for two hours in acidulated
or salt water. The water requires two or three spoonfuls of vinegar or
two spoonfuls of gray salt to the quart, and a quart of water is enough for
a pound of sliced mushrooms. After thus soaking, they are well washed
in fresh water, thrown into cold water, which is raised to the boiling point,
and, after remaining half an hour, taken out and again washed. G&eacute;rard,
to prove that "crumpets is wholesome," ate one hundred and seventy-five
pounds of the most poisonous mushrooms thus prepared, in a single month,
fed his family <i>ad libitum</i> with the same, and finally administered them, in
heroic doses, to the members of a committee appointed by the Council of
Health of the city of Paris. See <span class="smcap">Figuier</span>, <i>L'Ann&eacute;e Scientifique</i>, 1862, pp.
353, 384. See <i>Appendix</i>, <a href="#app_31">No. 31</a>.
</p><p>
It has long been known that the Russian peasantry eat, with impunity,
mushrooms of species everywhere else regarded as very poisonous. Is it
not probable that the secret of rendering them harmless&mdash;which was
known to Pliny, though since forgotten in Italy&mdash;is possessed by the
rustic Muscovites?</p></div>

seeds have grown after lying dormant for ages. The following cases, mentioned
by Dr. Dwight (<i>Travels</i>, ii, pp. 438, 439), may be new to many
readers:
</p><p>
"The lands [in Panton, Vermont], which have here been once cultivated,
and again permitted to lie waste for several years, yield a rich and
fine growth of hickory [<i>Carya porcina</i>]. Of this wood there is not, I believe,
a single tree in any original forest within fifty miles from this spot.
The native growth was here white pine, of which I did not see a single stem
in a whole grove of hickory."
</p><p>
The hickory is a walnut, bearing a fruit too heavy to be likely to be
carried fifty miles by birds, and besides, I believe it is not eaten by any
bird indigenous to Vermont.
</p><p>
"A field, about five miles from Northampton, on an eminence called
Rail Hill, was cultivated about a century ago. The native growth here,
and in all the surrounding region, was wholly oak, chestnut, &amp;c. As the
field belonged to my grandfather, I had the best opportunity of learning
its history. It contained about five acres, in the form of an irregular
parallelogram. As the savages rendered the cultivation dangerous, it was
given up. On this ground there sprang up a grove of white pines covering
the field and retaining its figure exactly. So far as I remember, there
was not in it a single oak or chestnut tree. * * * There was not a single
pine whose seeds were, or, probably, had for ages been, sufficiently
near to have been planted on this spot. The fact that these white pines
covered this field exactly, so as to preserve both its extent and its figure,
and that there were none in the neighborhood, are decisive proofs that cultivation
brought up the seeds of a former forest within the limits of vegetation,
and gave them an opportunity to germinate."</p></div>

pursued sylviculture on a really great scale, though admirable examples
have been set in many others on both sides of the Atlantic. In England
the law of primogeniture, and other institutions and national customs
which tend to keep large estates long undivided and in the same line of
inheritance, the wealth of the landholders, and the difficulty of finding safe
and profitable investments of capital, combine to afford encouragements
for the plantation of forests, which nowhere else exist in the same degree.
The climate of England, too, is very favorable to the growth of forest trees,
though the character of surface secures a large part of the island from the
evils which have resulted from the destruction of the woods elsewhere,
and therefore their restoration is a matter of less geographical importance
in England than on the Continent.</p></div>

Clav&eacute; (p. 248), France has 9,000 kilom&egrave;tres of railway in operation, 7,000
in construction, half of which is built with a double track. Adding turnouts
and extra tracks at stations, the number of ties required for a single
track is stated at 1,200 to the kilom&egrave;tre, or, as Clav&eacute; computes, for the
entire network of France, 58,000,000. As the schoolboys say, "this sum
does not prove;" for 16,000 + 8,000 for the double track halfway =
24,000, and 24,000 &times; 1,200 = 28,800,000. According to Bigelow (<i>Les &Eacute;tats
Unis en 1863</i>, p. 439), the United States had in operation or construction
on the first of January, 1862, 51,000 miles, or about 81,000 kilom&egrave;tres of
railroad, and the military operations of the present civil war are rapidly
extending the system. Allowing the same proportion as in France, the
American railroads required 97,200,000 ties in 1862. The consumption of
timber in Europe and America during the present generation, occasioned
by this demand, has required the sacrifice of many hundred thousand acres
of forest, and if we add the quantity employed for telegraph posts, we have
an amount of destruction, for entirely new purposes, which is really appalling.
</p><p>
The consumption of wood for lucifer matches is enormous, and I have
heard of several instances where tracts of pine forest, hundreds and even
thousands of acres in extent, have been purchased and felled, solely to
supply timber for this purpose.
</p><p>
The demand for wood for small carvings and for children's toys is incredibly
large. Rentzsch states the export of such objects from the town
of Sonneberg alone to have amounted, in 1853, to 60,000 centner, or three
thousand tons' weight.&mdash;<i>Der Wald</i>, p. 68. See <i>Appendix</i>, <a href="#app_33">No. 33</a>.
</p><p>
The importance of so managing the forest that it may continue indefinitely
to furnish an adequate supply of material for naval architecture is
well illustrated by some remarks of the same author in the valuable little
work just cited. He suggests that the prosperity of modern England is
due, in no small degree, to the supplies of wood and other material for
building and equipping ships, received from the forests of her colonies and
of other countries with which she has maintained close commercial relations,
and he adds: "Spain, which by her position seemed destined for
universal power, and once, in fact, possessed it, has lost her political rank,
because during the unwise administration of the successors of Philip II,
the empty exchequer could not furnish the means of building new fleets;
for the destruction of the forests had raised the price of timber above the
resources of the state."&mdash;<i>Der Wald</i>, p. 63.
</p><p>
The market price of timber, like that of all other commodities, may be
said, in a general way, to be regulated by the laws of demand and supply,
but it is also controlled by those seemingly unrelated accidents which so
often disappoint the calculations of political economists in other branches
of commerce. A curious case of this sort is noticed by <span class="smcap">Cerini</span>, <i>Dell'
Impianto e Conservazione dei Boschi</i>, p. 17: "In the mountains on the
Lago Maggiore, in years when maize is cheap, the woodcutters can provide
themselves with corn meal enough for a week by three days' labor,
and they refuse to work the remaining four. Hence the dealers in wood,
not being able to supply the demand, for want of laborers, are obliged to
raise the price for the following season, both for timber and for firewood;
so that a low price of grain occasions a high price of building lumber and
of fuel. The consequence is, that though the poor have supplied themselves
cheaply with food, they must pay dear for firewood, and they cannot
get work, because the high price of lumber has discouraged repairs
and building, the expense of which landed proprietors cannot undertake
when their incomes have been reduced by sales of grain at low rates, and
hence there is not demand enough for lumber to induce the timber merchants
to furnish employment to the woodmen."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_273_273" id="Footnote_273_273"></a><a href="#FNanchor_273_273"><span class="label">[273]</span></a> Besides the substitution of iron for wood, a great saving of consumption
of this latter material has been effected by the revival of ancient
methods of increasing its durability, and the invention of new processes
for the same purpose. The most effectual preservative yet discovered for
wood employed on land, is sulphate of copper, a solution of which is
introduced into the pores of the wood while green, by soaking, by forcing-pumps,
or, most economically, by the simple pressure of a column of the
fluid in a small pipe connected with the end of the piece of timber subjected
to the treatment. Clav&eacute; (<i>&Eacute;tudes Foresti&egrave;res</i>, pp. 240-249) gives an
interesting account of the various processes employed for rendering wood
imperishable, and states that railroad ties injected with sulphate of copper
in 1846, were found absolutely unaltered in 1855; and telegraphic posts
prepared two years earlier, are now in a state of perfect preservation.
</p><p>
For many purposes, the method of injection is too expensive, and some
simpler process is much to be desired. The question of the proper time
of felling timber is not settled, and the best modes of air, water, and steam
seasoning are not yet fully ascertained. Experiments on these subjects
would be well worth the patronage of governments in new countries,
where they can be very easily made, without the necessity of much waste
of valuable material, and without expensive arrangements for observation.
</p><p>
The practice of stripping living trees of their bark some years before
they are felled, is as old as the time of Vitruvius, but is much less followed
than it deserves, partly because the timber of trees so treated inclines to
crack and split, and partly because it becomes so hard as to be wrought
with considerable difficulty.
</p><p>
In America, economy in the consumption of fuel has been much promoted
by the substitution of coal for wood, the general use of stoves both
for wood and coal, and recently by the employment of anthracite in the
furnaces of stationary and locomotive steam-engines. All the objections
to the use of anthracite for this latter purpose appear to have been overcome,
and the improvements in its combustion have been attended with
a great pecuniary saving, and with much advantage to the preservation of
the woods.
</p><p>
The employment of coal has produced a great reduction in the consumption
of fire wood in Paris. In 1815, the supply of fire wood for the
city required 1,200,000 st&egrave;res, or cubic m&egrave;tres; in 1859, it had fallen to
501,805, while, in the mean time, the consumption of coal had risen from
600,000 to 432,000,000 metrical quintals. See <span class="smcap">Clav&eacute;</span>, <i>&Eacute;tudes</i>, p. 212.
</p><p>
I think there must be some error in this last sum, as 432 millions
of metrical quintals would amount to 43 millions of tons, a quantity which
it is difficult to suppose could be consumed in the city of Paris. The price
of fire wood has scarcely advanced at all in Paris for half a century, though
that of timber generally has risen enormously.</p></div>

extensive forests in France, may be mentioned the fact, that wolves were
abundant, not very long since, in parts of the empire where there are now
neither wolves nor woods to shelter them. Arthur Young more than once
speaks of the "innumerable multitudes" of these animals which infested
France in 1789, and George Sand states, in the <i>Histoire de ma Vie</i>, that
some years after the restoration of the Bourbons, they chased travellers
on horseback in the Southern provinces, and literally knocked at the doors
of her father-in-law's country seat.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_276_276" id="Footnote_276_276"></a><a href="#FNanchor_276_276"><span class="label">[276]</span></a> In the <i>Recepte V&eacute;ritable</i>, Palissy having expressed his indignation at
the folly of men in destroying the woods, his interlocutor defends the
policy of felling them, by citing the example of "divers bishops, cardinals,
priors, abbots, monkeries, and chapters, which, by cutting their woods,
have made three profits," the sale of the timber, the rent of the ground,
and the "good portion" they received of the grain grown by the peasants
upon it. To this argument, Palissy replies: "I cannot enough detest this
thing, and I call it not an error, but a curse and a calamity to all France;
for when forests shall be cut, all arts shall cease, and they which practise
them shall be driven out to eat grass with Nebuchadnezzar and the beasts
of the field. I have divers times thought to set down in writing the arts
which shall perish when there shall be no more wood; but when I had
written down a great number, I did perceive that there could be no end
of my writing, and having diligently considered, I found there was not
any which could be followed without wood." * * "And truly I could
well allege to thee a thousand reasons, but 'tis so cheap a philosophy, that
the very chamber wenches, if they do but think, may see that without
wood, it is not possible to exercise any manner of human art or cunning."&mdash;<i>&#338;uvres
de</i> <span class="smcap">Bernard Palissy</span>, p. 89.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_277_277" id="Footnote_277_277"></a><a href="#FNanchor_277_277"><span class="label">[277]</span></a> Since writing the above paragraph, I have found the view I have
taken of this point confirmed by the careful investigations of Rentzsch,
who estimates the proper proportion of woodland to entire surface at
twenty-three per cent. for the interior of Germany, and supposes that near
the coast, where the air is supplied with humidity by evaporation from
the sea, it might safely be reduced to twenty per cent. See Rentzsch's
very valuable prize essay, <i>Der Wald im Haushalt der Natur und der
Volkswirthschaft</i>, cap. viii.
</p><p>
The due proportion in France would considerably exceed that for the
German States, because France has relatively more surface unfit for any
growth but that of wood, because the form and geological character of her
mountains expose her territory to much greater injury from torrents, and
because at least her southern provinces are more frequently visited both
by extreme drought and by deluging rains.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_278_278" id="Footnote_278_278"></a><a href="#FNanchor_278_278"><span class="label">[278]</span></a> <i>&Eacute;tudes sur l'&Eacute;conomie Foresti&egrave;re</i>, p. 261. Clav&eacute; adds (p. 262): "The
Russian forests are very unequally distributed through the territory of this
vast empire. In the north they form immense masses, and cover whole
provinces, while in the south they are so completely wanting that
the inhabitants have no other fuel than straw, dung, rushes, and heath."
* * * "At Moscow, firewood costs thirty per cent. more than at
Paris, while, at the distance of a few leagues, it sells for a tenth of that
price."
</p><p>
This state of things is partly due to the want of facilities of transportation,
and some parts of the United States are in a similar condition.
During a severe winter, six or seven years ago, the sudden freezing of the
canals and rivers, before a large American town had received its usual
supply of fuel, occasioned an enormous rise in the price of wood and coal,
and the poor suffered severely for want of it. Within a few hours of the
city were large forests and an abundant stock of firewood felled and prepared
for burning. This might easily have been carried to town by the
railroads which passed through the woods; but the managers of the roads
refused to receive it as freight, because the opening of a new market
for wood might raise the price of the fuel they employed for their locomotives.
</p><p>
Hohenstein, who was long professionally employed as a forester in Russia,
describes the consequences of the general war upon the woods in that
country as already most disastrous, and as threatening still more ruinous
evils. The river Volga, the life artery of Russian internal commerce, is
drying up from this cause, and the great Muscovite plains are fast advancing
to a desolation like that of Persia.&mdash;<i>Der Wald</i>, p. 223.
</p><p>
The level of the Caspian Sea is eighty-three feet lower than that of the
Sea of Azoff, and the surface of Lake Aral is fast sinking. Von Baer
maintains that the depression of the Caspian was produced by a sudden
subsidence, from geological causes, and not gradually by excess of evaporation
over supply. See <i>Kaspische Studien</i>, p. 25. But this subsidence
diminished the area and consequently the evaporation of that sea, and the
rivers which once maintained its ancient equilibrium ought to raise it to
its former level, if their own flow had not been diminished. It is, indeed,
not proved that the laying bare of a wooded country diminishes the total
annual precipitation upon it; but it is certain that the summer evaporation
from the surface of a champaign region, like that through which the
Volga, its tributaries, and the feeders of Lake Aral flow, is increased by
the removal of its woods. Hence, though as much rain may still fall in
the valleys of those rivers as when their whole surface was covered with
forests, a less quantity of water may be delivered by them since their
basins were cleared, and therefore the present condition of the inland
waters in question may be due to the removal of the forests in their
basins.</p></div>

Probably no European countries can so well dispense with the forests,
in their capacity of conservative influences, as England and Ireland. Their
insular position and latitude secure an abundance of atmospheric moisture,
and the general inclination of surface is not such as to expose it to special
injury from torrents. The due proportion of woodland in England and
Ireland is, therefore, almost purely an economical question, to be decided
by the comparative direct pecuniary return from forest growth, pasturage,
and plough land.
</p><p>
In Scotland, where the country is for the most part more broken and
mountainous, the general destruction of the forests has been attended with
very serious evils, and it is in Scotland that many of the most extensive
British forest plantations have now been formed. But although the inclination
of surface in Scotland is rapid, the geological constitution of the soil
is not of a character to promote such destructive degradation by running
water as in Southern France, and it has not to contend with the parching
droughts by which the devastations of the torrents are rendered more injurious
in that part of the French empire.
</p><p>
In giving the proportion of woodland to population, I compute
Rentzsch's Morgen at .3882 of an English acre, because I find, by Alexander's
most accurate and valuable Dictionary of Weights and Measures,
that this is the value of the Dresden Morgen, and Rentzsch is a Saxon
writer. In the different German States, there are more than twenty different
land measures known by the name of Morgen, varying from about
one third of an acre to more than three acres in value. When will the
world be wise enough to unite in adopting the French metrical and monetary
systems? As to the latter, never while Christendom continues to be
ruled by money changers, who can compel you to part with your sovereigns
in France at twenty-five francs, and in England to accept fifteen shillings
for your napoleons. I speak as a sufferer. <i>Experto crede Roberto.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_280_280" id="Footnote_280_280"></a><a href="#FNanchor_280_280"><span class="label">[280]</span></a> According to the maxims of English jurisprudence, the common law
consists of general customs so long established that "the memory of man
runneth not to the contrary." In other words, long custom makes law.
In new countries, the change of circumstances creates new customs, and,
in time, new law, without the aid of legislation. Had the American colonists
observed a more sparing economy in the treatment of their woods, a
new code of customary forest law would have sprung up and acquired the
force of a statute. Popular habit was fast elaborating the fundamental
principles of such a code, when the rapid increase in the value of timber,
in consequence of the reckless devastation of the woodlands, made it the
interest of the proprietors to interfere with this incipient system of forest
jurisprudence, and appeal to the rules of English law for the protection
of their woods. The courts have sustained these appeals, and forest property
is now legally as inviolable as any other, though common opinion
still combats the course of judicial decision on such questions.
</p><p>
In the United States, swarms of honey bees, on leaving the parent
hive, often take up their quarters in hollow trees in the neighboring
woods. By the early customs of New England, the finder of a "bee tree"
on the land of another owner was regarded as entitled to the honey by
right of discovery; and as a necessary incident of that right, he might cut
the tree, at the proper season, without asking permission of the proprietor
of the soil. The quantity of "wild honey" in a tree was often large, and
"bee hunting" was so profitable that it became almost a regular profession.
The "bee hunter" sallied forth with a small box containing
honey and a little vermilion. The bees which were attracted by the
honey marked themselves with the vermilion, and hence were more
readily followed in their homeward flight, and recognized when they returned
a second time for booty. When loaded with spoil, this insect returns
to his hive by the shortest route, and hence a straight line is popularly
called in America a "bee line." By such a line, the hunter followed
the bees to their sylvan hive, marked the tree with his initials, and returned
to secure his prize in the autumn. When the right of the "bee
hunter" was at last disputed by the land proprietors, it was with difficulty
that judgments could be obtained, in inferior courts, in favor of the latter,
and it was only after repeated decisions of the higher legal tribunals that
the superior right of the owner of the soil was at last acquiesced in.</p></div>

of land almost without pecuniary value, but where labor is dear and
the rate of interest high, it is profitable to till a large surface at the least
possible cost; <i>extensive</i> cultivation is there the most advantageous. In
England, France, and Germany, where every corner of soil is occupied,
and the least bit of ground is sold at a high price, but where labor and
capital are comparatively cheap, it is wisest to employ <i>intensive</i> cultivation.
* * * All the efforts of the cultivator ought to be directed to
the obtaining of a given result with the least sacrifice, and there is equally
a loss to the commonwealth if the application of improved agricultural
processes be neglected where they are advantageous, or if they be employed
where they are not required. * * *  In this point of view,
sylviculture must follow the same laws as agriculture, and, like it, be
modified according to the economical conditions of different states. In
countries abounding in good forests, and thinly peopled, elementary and
cheap methods must be pursued; in civilized regions, where a dense population
requires that the soil shall be made to produce all it can yield, the
regular artificial forest, with all the processes that science teaches, should
be cultivated. It would be absurd to apply to the endless woods of Brazil
and of Canada the method of the Spessart by "double stages," and not
less so in our country, where every yard of ground has a high value, to
leave to nature the task of propagating trees, and to content ourselves
with cutting, every twenty or twenty-five years, the meagre growths that
chance may have produced."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_283_283" id="Footnote_283_283"></a><a href="#FNanchor_283_283"><span class="label">[283]</span></a> It is often laid down as a universal law, that the wood of trees of
slow vegetation is superior to that of quick growth. This is one of those
commonplaces by which men love to shield themselves from the labor of
painstaking observation. It has, in fact, so many exceptions, that it may
be doubted whether it is in any sense true. Most of the cedars are slow
of growth; but while the timber of some of them is firm and durable, that
of others is light, brittle, and perishable. The hemlock spruce is slower
of growth than the pines, but its wood is of very little value. The pasture
oak and beech show a breadth of grain&mdash;and, of course, an annual increment&mdash;twice
as great as trees of the same species grown in the woods; and
the American locust, <i>Robinia pseudacacia</i>, the wood of which is of extreme
toughness and durability, is, of all trees indigenous to Northeastern
America, by far the most rapid in growth.
</p><p>
As an illustration of the mutual interdependence of the mechanic arts,
I may mention that in Italy, where stone, brick, and plaster are almost the
only materials used in architecture, and where the "hollow ware" kitchen
implements are of copper or of clay, the ordinary tools for working wood
are of a very inferior description, and the locust timber is found too hard
for their temper. Southey informs us, in "Espriella's Letters," that when a
small quantity of mahogany was brought to England, early in the last
century, the cabinetmakers were unable to use it, from the defective temper
of their tools, until the demand for furniture from the new wood compelled
them to improve the quality of their implements. In America, the
cheapness of wood long made it the preferable material for almost all purposes
to which it could by any possibility be applied. The mechanical
cutlery and artisans' tools of the United States are of admirable temper,
finish, and convenience, and no wood is too hard, or otherwise too refractory,
to be wrought with great facility, both by hand tools and by the
multitude of ingenious machines which the Americans have invented for
this purpose.</p></div>

yields one third of the oil produced in France, and in this respect occupies
an intermediate position between the olive of the south, and the oleaginous
seeds of the north. A hectare (about two and a half acres), will produce
nuts to the value of five hundred francs a year, which cost nothing but
the gathering. Unfortunately, its maturity must be long waited for, and
more nut-trees are felled than planted. The demand for its wood in
cabinet work is the principal cause of its destruction. See <span class="smcap">Lavergne</span>,
<i>&Eacute;conomie Rurale de la France</i>, p. 253.
</p><p>
According to Cosimo Ridolfi (Lezioni Orali, ii. p. 424), France obtains
three times as much oil from the walnut as from the olive, and nearly as
much as from all oleaginous seeds together. He states that the walnut bears
nuts at the age of twenty years, and yields its maximum product at seventy,
and that a hectare of ground, with thirty trees, or twelve to the acre, is
equal to a capital of twenty-five hundred francs.
</p><p>
The nut of this tree is known in the United States as the "English
walnut." The fruit and the wood much resemble those of the American
black walnut, <i>Juglans nigra</i>, but for cabinet work the American is the
more beautiful material, especially when the large knots are employed.
The timber of the European species, when straight grained, and <i>clear</i>, or
free from knots, is, for ordinary purposes, better than that of the American
black walnut, but bears no comparison with the wood of the hickory, when
strength combined with elasticity is required, and its nut is very inferior
in taste to that of the shagbark, as well as to the butternut, which it somewhat
resembles.
</p><p>
"The chestnut is more valuable still, for it produces on a sterile soil,
which, without it, would yield only ferns and heaths, an abundant nutriment
for man."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lavergne</span>, <i>&Eacute;conomie Rurale de la France</i>, p. 253.

the walnut than in the chestnut, which latter tree is often grafted in

stumps, a property which it possesses in common with some other firs, the
maritime pine, and the European larch. When these trees grow in thick
clumps, their roots are apt to unite by a species of natural grafting, and
if one of them be felled, although its own proper rootlets die, the stump
may continue, sometimes for a century, to receive nourishment from the
radicles of the surrounding trees, and a dome of wood and bark of considerable
thickness be formed over it. The cicatrization is, however, only
apparent, for the entire stump, except the outside ring of annual growth,
soon dies, and even decays within its covering, without sending out new
shoots.</p></div>

outer bark for the first time. This first yield is of inferior quality, and is
employed for floats for nets and buoys, or burnt for lampblack. After this,
a new layer of cork, an inch or an inch and a quarter in thickness, is formed
about once in ten years, and is removed in large sheets without injury to
the tree, which lives a hundred and fifty years or more. According to
Clav&eacute; (p. 252), the annual product of a forest of cork oaks is calculated at
about 660 kilogrammes, worth 150 francs, to the hectare, which, deducting
expenses, leaves a profit of 100 francs. This is about equal to 250 pound
weight, and eight dollars profit to the acre. The cork oaks of the national
domain in Algeria cover about 500,000 acres, and are let to individuals at
rates which are expected, when the whole is rented, to yield to the state
a revenue of about $2,000,000.

George Sand, in the <i>Histoire de ma Vie</i>, speaks of the cork forests in
Southern France as among the most profitable of rural possessions, and
states, what I do not remember to have seen noticed elsewhere, that Russia
is the best customer for cork. The large sheets taken from the trees are
slit into thin plates, and used to line the walls of apartments in that cold
climate.</p></div>

the border between the countries I have mentioned, but the range of the
other trees is bounded by the Alps, and by a well-defined and sharply
drawn line to the west of those mountains. I cannot give statistical details
as to the number of any of the trees in question, or as to the area they
would cover if brought together in a given country. From some peculiarity
in the sky of Europe, cultivated plants will thrive, in Northern Italy,
in Southern France, and even in Switzerland, under a depth of shade
where no crop, not even grass, worth harvesting, would grow in the
United States with an equally high summer temperature. Hence the
cultivation of all these trees is practicable in Europe to a greater extent
than would be supposed reconcilable with the interests of agriculture.
Some idea of the importance of the olive orchards may be formed from
the fact that Sicily alone, an island scarcely exceeding 10,000 square miles
in area, of which one third at least is absolutely barren, has exported to
the single port of Marseilles more than 2,000,000 pounds weight of olive
oil per year, for the last twenty years.</p></div>

this pine is due to pruning. It is true that the extremities of the topmost

removed to a very considerable height, and it is not improbable that the
shape of the top is thereby affected.</p></div>

either an extraordinary <i>coup d'&#339;il</i> in the spectator, or a long study, in
order to master its relief, its plans, its salient and retreating angles. In
summer, the universal greenery confounds light and shade, distance and
foreground; and though the impression upon a traveller, who journeys for
the sake of "sensations," may be strengthened by the mysterious annihilation
of all standards for the measurement of space, yet the superior
intelligibility of the winter scenery of Italy is more profitable to those
who see with a view to analyze.</p></div>

been discovered in Arcadia, consisting of a fir which has the property of
sending up both vertical and lateral shoots from the stump of felled trees
and forming a new crown. It was at first supposed that this forest grew
only on the "mountains," of which the hero of About's most amusing story,
<i>Le Roi des Montagnes</i>, was "king;" but it is now said that small stumps,
with the shoots attached, have been sent to Germany, and recognized by
able botanists as true natural products.</p></div>

species, and experience has shown that oaks and other broad-leaved trees,
planted as artificial woods, require to be mixed, or associated with others
of different habits.
</p><p>
In the forest of Fontainebleau, "oaks, mingled with beeches in due
proportion," says Clav&eacute;, "may arrive at the age of five or six hundred
years in full vigor, and attain dimensions which I have never seen surpassed;
when, however, they are wholly unmixed with other trees, they
begin to decay and die at the top, at the age of forty or fifty years, like
men, old before their time, weary of the world, and longing only to quit
it. This has been observed in most of the oak plantations of which I have
spoken, and they have not been able to attain to full growth. When the
vegetation was perceived to languish, they were cut, in the hope that this
operation would restore their vigor, and that the new shoots would succeed
better than the original trees; and, in fact, they seemed to be recovering
for the first few years. But the shoots were soon attacked by the
same decay, and the operation had to be renewed at shorter and shorter
intervals, until at last it was found necessary to treat as coppices plantations
originally designed for the full-growth system. Nor was this all:
the soil, periodically bared by these cuttings, became impoverished, and
less and less suited to the growth of the oak. * * * It was then proposed
to introduce the pine and plant with it the vacancies and glades.
* * * By this means, the forest was saved from the ruin which threatened
it, and now more than 10,000 acres of pines, from fifteen to thirty
years old, are disseminated at various points, sometimes intermixed with
broad-leaved trees, sometimes forming groves by themselves."&mdash;<i>Revue des
Deux Mondes</i>, Mai, 1863, pp. 153, 154.
</p><p>
The forests of Denmark, which, in modern times, have been succeeded
by the beech&mdash;a species more inclined to be exclusive than any other
broad-leaved tree&mdash;were composed of birches, oaks, firs, aspens, willows,
hazel, and maple, the first three being the leading species. At present,
the beech greatly predominates.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Vaupell</span>, <i>B&ouml;gens Indvandring</i>, pp. 19, 20.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_298_298" id="Footnote_298_298"></a><a href="#FNanchor_298_298"><span class="label">[298]</span></a> The grounds which it is most important to clothe with wood as a
conservative influence, and which, also, can best be spared from agricultural
use, are steep hillsides. But the performance of all the offices of the
forester to the tree&mdash;seeding, planting, thinning, and finally felling and removing
for consumption&mdash;is more laborious upon a rapid declivity than on
a level soil, and at the same time it is difficult to apply irrigation or
manures to trees so situated. Experience has shown that there is great
advantage in terracing the face of a hill before planting it, both as preventing
the wash of the earth by checking the flow of water down its
slope, and as presenting a surface favorable for irrigation, as well as for
manuring and cultivating the tree. But even without so expensive a process,
very important results have been obtained by simply ditching declivities.
"In order to hasten the growth of wood on the flanks of a mountain,
Mr. Eug&egrave;ne Chevandier divided the slope into zones forty or fifty
feet wide, by horizontal ditches closed at both ends, and thereby obtained,
from firs of different ages, shoots double the dimensions of those which
grew on a dry soil of the same character, where the water was allowed to
run off without obstruction."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dumont</span>, <i>Des Travaux Publics, etc.</i>, pp.
94-96.
</p><p>
The ditches were about two feet and a half deep, and three feet and a
half wide, and they cost about forty francs the hectare, or three dollars the
acre. This extraordinary growth was produced wholly by the retention
of the rain water in the ditches, whence it filtered through the whole soil
and supplied moisture to the roots of the trees. It may be doubted
whether in a climate cold enough to freeze the entire contents of the
ditches in winter, it would not be expedient to draw off the water in the
autumn, as the presence of so large a quantity of ice in the soil might prove
injurious to trees too young and small to shelter the ground effectually
against frost.
</p><p>
Chevandier computes that, if the annual growth of the pine in the
marshy soil of the Vosges be represented by one, it will equal two in dry
ground, four or five on slopes so ditched or graded as to retain the water
flowing upon them from roads or steep declivities, and six where the
earth is kept constantly moist by infiltration from running brooks.&mdash;<i>Comptes
Rendus &agrave; l'Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences</i>&mdash;t. xix, Juillet, Dec., 1844,
p. 167.
</p><p>
The effect of accidental irrigation is well shown in the growth of the
trees planted along the canals of irrigation which traverse the fields in
many parts of Italy. They flourish most luxuriantly, in spite of continual
lopping, and yield a very important contribution to the stock of fuel for
domestic use; while trees, situated so far from canals as to be out of the
reach of infiltration from them, are of much slower growth, under circumstances
otherwise equally favorable.
</p><p>
In other experiments of Chevandier, under better conditions, the yield
of wood was increased, by judicious irrigation, in the ratio of seven to one,
the profits in that of twelve to one. At the Exposition of 1855, Chambrelent
exhibited young trees, which, in four years from the seed, had grown
to the height of sixteen and twenty feet, and the diameter of ten and
twelve inches. Chevandier experimented with various manures, and
found that some of them might be profitably applied to young, but not
to old trees, the quantity required in the latter case being too great.
Wood ashes and the refuse of soda factories are particularly recommended.
I have seen an extraordinary growth produced in fir trees by the application
of soapsuds.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_299_299" id="Footnote_299_299"></a><a href="#FNanchor_299_299"><span class="label">[299]</span></a> Although the economy of the forest has received little attention in
the United States, no lover of American nature can have failed to observe
a marked difference between a native wood from which cattle are excluded
and one where they are permitted to browse. A few seasons suffice for
the total extirpation of the "underbrush," including the young trees on
which alone the reproduction of the forest depends, and all the branches
of those of larger growth which hang within reach of the cattle are
stripped of their buds and leaves, and soon wither and fall off. These
effects are observable at a great distance, and a wood pasture is recognized,
almost as far as it can be seen, by the regularity with which its lower
foliage terminates at what Ruskin somewhere calls the "cattle line." This
always runs parallel to the surface of the ground, and is determined by the
height to which domestic quadrupeds can reach to feed upon the leaves.
In describing a visit to the grand-ducal farm of San Rossore near Pisa,
where a large herd of camels is kept, Chateauvieux says: "In passing
through a wood of evergreen oaks, I observed that all the twigs and
foliage of the trees were clipped up to the height of about twelve feet
above the ground, without leaving a single spray below that level. I was
informed that the browsing of the camels had trimmed the trees as high
as they could reach."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lullin de Chateauvieux</span>, <i>Lettres sur l'Italie</i>, p. 113.
</p><p>
The removal of the shelter afforded by the brushwood and the pendulous
branches of trees permits drying and chilling winds to parch and cool
the ground, and of course injuriously affects the growth of the wood. But
this is not all. The tread of quadrupeds exposes and bruises the roots of
the trees, which often die from this cause, as any one may observe by following
the paths made by cattle through woodlands.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_300_300" id="Footnote_300_300"></a><a href="#FNanchor_300_300"><span class="label">[300]</span></a> I have remarked elsewhere that most insects which deposit and hatch
their eggs in the wood of the natural forest confine themselves to dead
trees. Not only is this the fact, but it is also true that many of the borers
attack only freshly cut timber. Their season of labor is a short one, and
unless the tree is cut during this period, it is safe from them. In summer
you may hear them plying their augers in the wood of a young pine with
soft green bark, as you sit upon its trunk, within a week after it has been
felled, but the windfalls of the winter lie uninjured by the worm and even
undecayed for centuries. In the pine woods of New England, after the
regular lumberman has removed the standing trees, these old trunks are
hauled out from the mosses and leaves which half cover them, and often
furnish excellent timber. The slow decay of such timber in the woods, it
may be remarked, furnishes another proof of the uniformity of temperature
and humidity in the forest, for the trunk of a tree lying on grass or
plough land, and of course exposed to all the alternations of climate, hardly
resists complete decomposition for a generation. The forests of Europe
exhibit similar facts. Wessely, in a description of the primitive wood of
Neuwald in Lower Austria, says that the windfalls required from 150 to
200 years for entire decay.-<i>-Die Oesterreichischen Alpenl&auml;nder und ihre
Forste</i>, p. 312.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_301_301" id="Footnote_301_301"></a><a href="#FNanchor_301_301"><span class="label">[301]</span></a> <span class="smcap">Vaupell</span>, <i>B&ouml;gens Indvandring i de Danske Skove</i>, pp. 29, 46. Vaupell
further observes, on the page last quoted: "The removal of leaves is injurious
to the forest, not only because it retards the growth of trees, but
still more because it disqualifies the soil for the production of particular
species. When the beech languishes, and the development of its branches
is less vigorous and its crown less spreading, it becomes unable to resist
the encroachments of the fir. This latter tree thrives in an inferior soil,
and being no longer stifled by the thick foliage of the beech, it spreads
gradually through the wood, while the beech retreats before it and finally
perishes."
</p><p>
The study of the natural order of succession in forest trees is of the
utmost importance in sylviculture, because it guides us in the selection of
the species to be employed in planting a new or restoring a decayed forest.
When ground is laid bare both of trees and of vegetable mould, and left
to the action of unaided and unobstructed nature, she first propagates trees
which germinate and grow only under the influence of a full supply of
light and air, and then, in succession, other species, according to their
ability to bear the shade and their demand for more abundant nutriment.
In Northern Europe, the larch, the white birch, the aspen, first appear;
then follow the maple, the alder, the ash, the fir; then the oak and the
linden; and then the beech. The trees called by these respective names
in the United States are not specifically the same as their European namesakes,
nor are they always even the equivalents of these latter, and therefore
the order of succession in America would not be precisely as indicated
by the foregoing list, but it nevertheless very nearly corresponds to it.
</p><p>
It is thought important to encourage the growth of the beech in Denmark
and Northern Germany, because it upon the whole yields better
returns than other trees, and particularly because it appears not to
exhaust, but on the contrary to enrich the soil; for by shedding its leaves
it returns to it most of the nutriment it has drawn from it, and at the same
time furnishes a solvent which aids materially in the decomposition of its
mineral constituents.
</p><p>
When the forest is left to itself, the order of succession is constant, and
its occasional inversion is always explicable by some human interference.
It is curious that the trees which require most light are content with the
poorest soils, and <i>vice versa</i>. The trees which first appear are also those
which propagate themselves farthest to the north. The birch, the larch,
and the fir bear a severer climate than the oak, the oak than the beech.
"These parallelisms," says Vaupell, "are very interesting, because they
are entirely independent of each other," and each prescribes the same
order of succession.&mdash;<i>B&ouml;gens Indvandring</i>, p. 42.</p></div>

polled, they throw out a great number of very thick-leaved shoots, which
arrange themselves in a globular head, so unlike the natural crown of the
acacia, that persons familiar only with the untrained tree often take them
for a different species.</p></div>

because, though the consumption of animal food diminishes the amount of
vegetable aliment required for human use, yet the animals themselves consume
a great quantity of grain and roots grown on ground ploughed and
cultivated as regularly and as laboriously as any other.
</p><p>
The 170,000,000 bushels of oats raised in the United States in 1860,
and fed to the 6,000,000 horses, the potatoes, the turnips, and the maize
employed in fattening the oxen, the sheep, and the swine slaughtered
the same year, occupied an extent of ground which, cultivated by hand
labor and with Chinese industry and skill, would probably have produced
a quantity of vegetable food equal in alimentary power to the flesh of the
quadrupeds killed for domestic use. Hence, so far as the naked question of
<i>amount</i> of aliment is concerned, the meadows and the pastures might as
well have remained in the forest condition.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_304_304" id="Footnote_304_304"></a><a href="#FNanchor_304_304"><span class="label">[304]</span></a> According to Clav&eacute; (<i>&Eacute;tudes</i>, p. 159), the net revenue from the forests
of the state in France, making no allowance for interest on the capital
represented by the forest, is two dollars per acre. In Saxony it is about
the same, though the cost of administration is twice as much as in France;
in W&uuml;rtemberg it is about a dollar an acre; and in Prussia, where half the
income is consumed in the expenses of administration, it sinks to less than
half a dollar. This low rate in Prussia is partly explained by the fact that
a considerable proportion of the annual product of wood is either conceded
to persons claiming prescriptive rights, or sold, at a very small price, to
the poor. Taking into account the capital invested in forest land, and
adding interest upon it, Pressler calculates that a pine wood, managed with
a view to felling it when eighty years old, would yield only one eighth of
one per cent. annual profit; a fir wood, at one hundred years, one sixth of
one per cent.; a beech wood, at one hundred and twenty years, one fourth
of one per cent. The same author (p. 335) gives the net income of the
New forest in England, over and above expenses, interest not computed, at
twenty-five cents per acre only. In America, where no expense is bestowed
upon the woods, the annual growth would generally be estimated
much higher.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_305_305" id="Footnote_305_305"></a><a href="#FNanchor_305_305"><span class="label">[305]</span></a> It is rare that a middle-aged American dies in the house where he
was born, or an old man even in that which he has built; and this is
scarcely less true of the rural districts, where every man owns his habitation,
than of the city, where the majority live in hired houses. This life
of incessant flitting is unfavorable for the execution of permanent improvements
of every sort, and especially of those which, like the forest, are
slow in repaying any part of the capital expended in them. It requires a
very generous spirit in a landholder to plant a wood on a farm he expects
to sell, or which he knows will pass out of the hands of his descendants
at his death. But the very fact of having begun a plantation would attach
the proprietor more strongly to the soil for which he had made such a
sacrifice; and the paternal acres would have a greater value in the eyes of
a succeeding generation, if thus improved and beautified by the labors of
those from whom they were inherited. Landed property, therefore, the
transfer of which is happily free from every legal impediment or restriction
in the United States, would find, in the feelings thus prompted, a
moral check against a too frequent change of owners, and would tend to
remain long enough in one proprietor or one family to admit of gradual
improvements which would increase its value both to the possessor and to
the state.</p></div>

nor can I refer to any passage in Roman literature in which sea dikes are
expressly mentioned otherwise than as walls or piers, except that in Pliny

the applicability of military instrumentalities to pacific art. The sale of
gunpowder in the United States, he informs me, is smaller since the commencement
of the present rebellion than before, because the war has
caused the suspension of many public and private improvements, in the
execution of which great quantities of powder were used for blasting.
</p><p>
It is alleged that the same observation was made in France during the
Crimean war, and that, in general, not ten per cent. of the powder manufactured
on either side of the Atlantic is employed for military purposes.
</p><p>
It is a fact not creditable to the moral sense of modern civilization, that
very many of the most important improvements in machinery and the
working of metals have originated in the necessities of war, and that
man's highest ingenuity has been shown, and many of his most remarkable
triumphs over natural forces achieved, in the contrivance of engines for
the destruction of his fellow man. The military material employed by the
first Napoleon has become, in less than two generations, nearly as obsolete
as the sling and stone of the shepherd, and attack and defence now begin
at distances to which, half a century ago, military reconnoissances hardly
extended. Upon a partial view of the subject, the human race seems destined
to become its own executioner&mdash;on the one hand, exhausting the capacity
of the earth to furnish sustenance to her taskmaster; on the other,
compensating diminished production by inventing more efficient methods
of exterminating the consumer.
</p><p>
But war develops great civil virtues, and brings into action a degree
and kind of physical energy which seldom fails to awaken a new intellectual
life in a people that achieves great moral and political results through
great heroism and endurance and perseverance. Domestic corruption has
destroyed more nations than foreign invasion, and a people is rarely conquered
till it has deserved subjugation.</p></div>

One is not sorry to learn that the Spanish tyranny in the Netherlands
had some compensations. The great chain of ring dikes which surrounds
a large part of Zeeland is due to the energy of Caspar de Robles, the
Spanish governor of that province, who in 1570 ordered the construction
of these works at the public expense, as a substitute for the private embankments
which had previously partially served the same purpose.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wild</span>,

by one or more rows of piles driven deeply down into the bed of the sea
in front of them. "Triple rows of piles of Scandinavian pine," says Wild,
"have been driven down along the coast of Friesland, where there are no
dunes, for a distance of one hundred and fifty miles. The piles are bound
together by strong cross timbers and iron clamps, and the interstices filled
with stones. The ground adjacent to the piling is secured with fascines,
and at exposed points heavy blocks of stone are heaped up as an additional
protection. The earth dike is built behind the mighty bulwark of this
breakwater, and its foot also is fortified with stones." * * * "The
great Helder dike is about five miles long and forty feet wide at the top,
along which runs a good road. It slopes down two hundred feet into the
sea, at an angle of forty degrees. The highest waves do not reach the
summit, the lowest always cover its base. At certain distances, immense
buttresses, of a height and width proportioned to those of the dike, and
even more strongly built, run several hundred feet out into the rolling sea.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_318_318" id="Footnote_318_318"></a><a href="#FNanchor_318_318"><span class="label">[318]</span></a> The shaking of the ground, even when loaded with large buildings,
by the passage of heavy carriages or artillery, or by the march of a body
of cavalry or even infantry, shows that such causes may produce important
mechanical effects on the condition of the soil. The bogs in the Netherlands,
as in most other countries, contain large numbers of fallen trees,
buried to a certain depth by earth and vegetable mould. When the bogs
are dry enough to serve as pastures, it is observed that trunks of these ancient
trees rise of themselves to the surface. Staring ascribes this singular
phenomenon to the agitation of the ground by the tread of cattle. "When
roadbeds," observes he, "are constructed of gravel and pebbles of different
sizes, and these latter are placed at the bottom without being broken
and rolled hard together, they are soon brought to the top by the effect of
travel on the road. Lying loosely, they undergo some motion from the
passage of every wagon wheel and the tread of every horse that passes
over them. This motion is an oscillation or partial rolling, and as one
side of a pebble is raised, a little fine sand or earth is forced under it, and
the frequent repetition of this process by cattle or carriages moving in
opposite directions brings it at last to the surface. We may suppose that
a similar effect is produced on the stems of trees in the bogs by the tread
of animals."&mdash;<i>De Bodem van Nederland</i>, i, pp. 75, 76.
</p><p>
It is observed in the Northern United States, that when soils containing
pebbles are cleared and cultivated, and the stones removed from the surface,
new pebbles, and even bowlders of many pounds weight, continue to
show themselves above the ground, every spring, for a long series of years.
In clayey soils the fence posts are thrown up in a similar way, and it is not
uncommon to see the lower rail of a fence thus gradually raised a foot or
even two feet above the ground. This rising of stones and fences is popularly
ascribed to the action of the severe frosts of that climate. The
expansion of the ground, in freezing, it is said, raises its surface, and, with
the surface, objects lying near or connected with it. When the soil thaws
in the spring, it settles back again to its former level, while the pebbles
and posts are prevented from sinking as low as before by loose earth which
has fallen under them. The fact that the elevation spoken of is observed
only in the spring, gives countenance to this theory, which is perhaps
applicable also to the cases stated by Staring, and it is probable that the
two causes above assigned concur in producing the effect.
</p><p>
The question of the subsidence of the Netherlandish coast has been
much discussed. Not to mention earlier geologists, Venema, in several
essays, and particularly in <i>Het Dalen van de Noordelijke Kuststreken van
ons Land</i>, 1854, adduces many facts and arguments to prove a slow sinking
of the northern provinces of Holland. Laveleye (<i>Affaissement du sol et
envasement des fleuves survenus dans les temps historiques</i>, 1859), upon a
still fuller investigation, arrives at the same conclusion. The eminent
geologist Staring, however, who briefly refers to the subject in <i>De Bodem
van Nederland</i>, i, p. 356 <i>et seqq.</i>, does not consider the evidence sufficient
to prove anything more than the sinking of the surface of the polders
from drying and consolidation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_319_319" id="Footnote_319_319"></a><a href="#FNanchor_319_319"><span class="label">[319]</span></a> The elevation of the lands enclosed by dikes&mdash;or <i>polders</i>, as they are
called in Holland&mdash;above low water mark, depends upon the height of the
tides, or, in other words, upon, the difference between ebb and flood. The
tide cannot deposit earth higher than it flows, and after the ground is once
enclosed, the decay of the vegetables grown upon it and the addition of
manures do not compensate the depression occasioned by drying and consolidation.
On the coast of Zeeland and the islands of South Holland, the
tides, and of course the surface of the lands deposited by them, are so high
that the polders can be drained by ditching and sluices, but at other points,
as in the enclosed grounds of North Holland on the Zuiderzee, where the
tide rises but three feet or even less, pumping is necessary from the beginning.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Staring</span>,

drained or are of comparatively small extent, the existence of large floating
islands seems incredible, and has sometimes been treated as a fable, but no
geographical fact is better established. Kohl (<i>Inseln und Marschen Schleswig-Holsteins</i>,
iii, p. 309) reminds us that Pliny mentions among the
wonders of Germany the floating islands, covered with trees, which met
the Roman fleets at the mouths of the Elbe and the Weser. Our author
speaks also of having visited, in the territory of Bremen, floating moors,
bearing not only houses but whole villages. At low stages of the water
these moors rest upon a bed of sand, but are raised from six to ten feet by
the high water of spring, and remain afloat until, in the course of the summer,
the water beneath is exhausted by evaporation and drainage, when
they sink down upon the sand again. See <i>Appendix</i>, <a href="#app_40">No. 40</a>.
</p><p>
Staring explains, in an interesting way, the whole growth, formation, and
functions of floating fens or bogs, in his very valuable work, <i>De Bodem van</i>
<i>Nederland</i>, i, pp. 36-43. The substance of his account is as follows: The
first condition for the growth of the plants which compose the substance
of turf and the surface of the fens, is stillness of the water. Hence they
are not found in running streams, nor in pools so large as to be subject to
frequent agitation by the wind. For example, not a single plant grew in
the open part of the Lake of Haarlem, and fens cease to form in all pools
as soon as, by the cutting of the turf for fuel or other purposes, their area
is sufficiently enlarged to be much acted on by wind. When still water
above a yard deep is left undisturbed, aquatic plants of various genera,
such us Nuphar, Nymph&aelig;a, Limnanthemum, Stratiotes, Polygonum, and
Potamogeton, fill the bottom with roots and cover the surface with leaves.
Many of the plants die every year, and prepare at the bottom a soil fit for
the growth of a higher order of vegetation, Phragmites, Acorus, Sparganium,
Rumex, Lythrum, Pedicularis, Spir&aelig;a, Polystichum, Comarum,
Caltha, &amp;c., &amp;c. In the course of twenty or thirty years the muddy
bottom is filled with roots of aquatic and marsh plants, which are lighter
than water, and if the depth is great enough to give room for detaching
this vegetable network, a couple of yards for example, it rises to the surface,
bearing with it, of course, the soil formed above it by decay of stems
and leaves. New genera now appear upon the mass, such as Carex, Menyanthes,
and others, and soon thickly cover it. The turf has now acquired
a thickness of from two to four feet, and is called in Groningen <i>lad</i>; in
Friesland, <i>til</i>, <i>tilland</i>, or <i>drijftil</i>; in Overijssel, <i>krag</i>; and in Holland,
<i>rietzod</i>. It floats about as driven by the wind, gradually increasing in
thickness by the decay of its annual crops of vegetation, and in about half
a century reaches the bottom and becomes fixed. If it has not been invaded
in the mean time by men or cattle, trees and arborescent plants,
Alnus, Salix, Myrica, &amp;c. appear, and these contribute to hasten the attachment
of the turf to the bottom, both by their weight and by sending their
roots quite through into the ground.
</p><p>
This is the regular method employed by nature for the gradual filling
up of shallow lakes and pools, and converting them first into morass and
then into dry land. Whenever therefore man removes the peat or turf, he
exerts an injurious geographical agency, and, as I have already said, there
is no doubt that the immense extension of the inland seas of Holland in
modern times is owing to this and other human imprudences. "Hundreds
of hectares of floating pastures," says our author, "which have nothing in
their appearance to distinguish them from grass lands resting on solid bog,
are found in Overijssel, in North Holland and near Utrecht. In short, they
occur in all deep bogs, and wherever deep water is left long undisturbed."
</p><p>
In one case, a floating island, which had attached itself to the shore,
continued to float about for a long time after it was torn off by a flood,
and was solid enough to keep a pond of fresh water upon it sweet, though
the water in which it was swimming had become brackish from the irruption
of the sea. After the hay is cut, cattle are pastured upon those
islands, and they sometimes have large trees growing upon them.
</p><p>
When the turf or peat has been cut, leaving water less than a yard
deep, Equisetum limosum grows at once, and is followed by the second
class of marsh plants mentioned above. Their roots do not become detached
from the bottom in such shallow water, but form ordinary turf or
peat. These processes are so rapid that a thickness of from three to six
feet of turf is formed in half a century, and many men have lived to mow
grass where they had fished in their boyhood, and to cut turf twice in the
same spot.
</p><p>
Captain Gilliss says that before Lake Taguataga in Chili was drained,
there were in it islands composed of dead plants matted together to a
thickness of from four to six feet, and with trees of medium size growing
upon them. These islands floated before the wind "with their trees and
browsing cattle."&mdash;<i>United States Naval Astronomical Expedition to the

of Jacini, to the effect that the great Italian lakes discharge themselves
partly by infiltration beneath the hills which bound them. The amount
of such infiltration must depend much upon the hydrostatic pressure on
the walls of the lake basins, and, of course, the lowering of the surface of
these lakes, by diminishing that pressure, would diminish also the infiltration.
It is now proposed to lower the level of the Lake of Como some
feet by deepening its outlet. It is possible that the effect of this may
manifest itself in a diminution of the water in springs and <i>fontanili</i> or
artesian wells in Lombardy. See <i>Appendix</i>, <a href="#app_43">No. 43</a>.</p></div>

are not the only damage caused by the waters to the plains of Tuscany.
Raised, as the canals are, above the soil, the water percolates through
their banks, penetrates every obstruction, and, in spite of all the efforts
of industry, sterilizes and turns to morasses fields which nature and the
richness of the soil seemed to have designed for the most abundant harvests.
In ground thus pervaded with moisture, or rendered <i>cold</i>, as the
Tuscans express it, by the filtration of the canal water, the vines and the
mulberries, after having for a few years yielded fruit of a saltish taste, rot
and perish. The wheat decays in the ground, or dies as soon as it sprouts.
Winter crops are given up, and summer cultivation tried for a time; but
the increasing humidity, and the saline matter communicated to the earth&mdash;which affects the taste of all its products, even to the grasses, which the
cattle refuse to touch&mdash;at last compel the husbandman to abandon his
fields, and leave uncultivated a soil that no longer repays his labor."&mdash;<i>Tableau

Italy is partly explained by the fact that the superficial stratum of fine
earth and vegetable mould is very extensively underlaid by beds of pebbles
and gravel brought down by mountain torrents at a remote epoch. The
water of the surface soil drains rapidly down into these loose beds, and
passes off by subterranean channels to some unknown point of discharge;
but this circumstance alone is not a sufficient solution. Is it not possible
that the habits of vegetables, grown in countries where irrigation has been
immemorially employed, have been so changed that they require water
under conditions of soil and climate where their congeners, which have
not been thus indulgently treated, do not?
</p><p>
There are some atmospheric phenomena in Northern Italy, which an
American finds it hard to reconcile with what he has observed in the
United States. To an American eye, for instance, the sky of Piedmont,
Lombardy, and the northern coast of the Mediterranean, is always whitish
and curdled, and it never has the intensity and fathomless depth of the
blue of his native heavens. And yet the heat of the sun's rays, as measured
by sensation, and, at the same time, the evaporation, are greater than
they would be with the thermometer at the same point in America. I
have frequently felt in Italy, with the mercury below 60&deg; Fahrenheit, and
with a mottled and almost opaque sky, a heat of solar irradiation which
I can compare to nothing but the scorching sensation experienced in
America at a temperature twenty degrees higher, during the intervals between
showers, or before a rain, when the clear blue of the sky seems
infinite in depth and transparency. Such circumstances may create a
necessity for irrigation where it would otherwise be superfluous, if not
absolutely injurious.
</p><p>
In speaking of the superior apparent clearness of the <i>sky</i> in America, I
confine myself to the concave vault of the heavens, and do not mean to
assert that terrestrial objects are generally visible at greater distances in
the United States than in Italy. Indeed I am rather disposed to maintain
the contrary; for though I know that the lower strata of the atmosphere
in Europe never equal in transparency the air near the earth in New
Mexico, Peru, and Chili, yet I think the accidents of the coast line of the
Riviera, as, for example, between Nice and La Spezia, and those of the incomparable
Alpine panorama seen from Turin, are distinguishable at greater
distances than they would be in the United States.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_331_331" id="Footnote_331_331"></a><a href="#FNanchor_331_331"><span class="label">[331]</span></a> In Egypt, evaporation and absorption by the earth are so rapid, that
all annual crops require irrigation during the whole period of their growth.
As fast as the water retires by the subsidence of the annual inundation, the
seed is sown upon the still moist uncovered soil, and irrigation begins at
once. Upon the Nile, you hear the creaking of the water wheels, and
sometimes the movement of steam pumps, through the whole night, while
the poorer cultivators unceasingly ply the simple <i>shadoof</i>, or bucket-and-sweep,
laboriously raising the water from trough to trough by as many as
six or seven stages when the river is low. The bucket is of flexible leather,
with a stiff rim, and is emptied into the trough, not by inverting it like a
wooden bucket, but by putting the hand beneath and pushing the bottom
up till the water all runs out over the brim, or, in other words, by turning
the vessel inside out.
</p><p>
The quantity of water thus withdrawn from the Nile is enormous.
Most of this is evaporated directly from the surface or the superficial
strata, but some moisture percolates down and oozes through the banks
into the river again, while a larger quantity sinks till it joins the slow current
of infiltration by which the Nile water pervades the earth of the
valley to the distance, at some points, of not less than fifty miles.</p></div>

preservation that I found not less than ten feet of water in it in the month
of June, 1851.
</p><p>
The brook Ain Musa, which runs through the city of Petra and finally
disappears in the sands of Wadi el Araba, is a considerable river in winter,
and the inhabitants of that town were obliged to excavate a tunnel through
the rock near the right bank, just above the upper entrance of the Sik, to
discharge a part of its swollen current. The sagacity of Dr. Robinson
detected the necessity of this measure, though the tunnel, the mouth of
which was hidden by brushwood, was not discovered till some time after
his visit. I even noticed unequivocal remains of a sluice by which the
water was diverted to the tunnel near the arch that crosses the Sik. Immense
labor was also expended in widening the natural channel at several
points below the town, to prevent the damming up and setting back of the
water&mdash;a fact I believe not hitherto noticed by travellers.
</p><p>
The Fellahheen above Petra still employ the waters of Ain Musa for
irrigation, and in summer the superficial current is wholly diverted from
its natural channel for that purpose. At this season, the bed of the brook,
which is composed of pebbles, gravel, and sand, is dry in the Sik and
through the town; but the infiltration is such that water is generally
found by digging to a small depth in the channel. Observing these facts
in a visit to Petra in the summer, I was curious to know whether the subterranean
waters escaped again to daylight, and I followed the ravine
below the town for a long distance. Not very far from the upper entrance
of the ravine, arborescent vegetation appeared upon its bottom, and as soon
as the ground was well shaded, a thread of water burst out. This was
joined by others a little lower down, and, at the distance of a mile from the
town, a strong current was formed and ran down toward Wadi el Araba.</p></div>

5,626 square miles." By geographical mile is here meant, I suppose, the
nautical mile of sixty to an equatorial degree, or about 2,025 yards. The
whole area, then, by this estimate, is 12,682 square statute or English
miles, that of the space "cultivated or fit for cultivation," 7,447. Smith's
<i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography</i>, article "&AElig;gyptus," gives
2,255 square miles as the area of the valley between Syene and the bifurcation
of the Nile, exclusive of the Fayoom, which is estimated at 340.
The area of the Delta is stated at 1,976 square miles between the main
branches of the river, and, including the irrigated lands east and west of
those branches, at 4,500 square miles. This latter work does not inform us
whether these are statute or nautical miles, but nautical miles must be
intended.
</p><p>
Other writers give estimates differing considerably from those just
cited. The latest computations I have seen are those in the first volume
of Kremer's <i>&AElig;gypten</i>, 1863. This author (pp. 6, 7) assigns to the Delta an
area of 200 square German geographical miles (fifteen to the degree); to all
Lower Egypt, including, of course, the Delta, 400 such miles. These numbers
are equal, respectively, to 4,239 and 8,478 square statute miles, and
the great lagoons are embraced in the areas computed. Upper Egypt
(above Cairo) is said (p. 11) to contain 4,000,000 feddan of <i>culturfl&auml;che</i>, or
cultivable land. The feddan is stated (p. 37) to contain 7,333 square piks,
the pik being 75 centim&egrave;tres, and it therefore corresponds almost exactly
to the English acre. Hence, according to Kremer, the cultivable soil of
Upper Egypt is 6,250 square statute miles, or twice as much as the whole
area of the valley between Syene and the bifurcation of the Nile, according
to Smith's <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography</i>. I suspect that
4,000,000 feddan is erroneously given as the cultivable area of Upper
Egypt alone, when in fact it should be taken for the arable surface of both
Lower and Upper Egypt; for from the statistical tables in the same volume,
it appears that 3,317,125 feddan, or 5,253 square statute miles, were
cultivated, in both geographical divisions, in the year referred to in the
tables, the date of which is not stated.
</p><p>
The area which the Nile would now cover at high water, if left to itself,
is greater than in ancient times, because the bed of the river has been elevated,
and consequently the lateral spread of the inundation increased. See
SMITH'S <i>Dictionary of Geography</i>, article "&AElig;gyptus." But the industry
of the Egyptians in the days of the Pharaohs and the Ptolomies carried
the Nile-water to large provinces which have now been long abandoned
and have relapsed into the condition of a desert. "Anciently," observes
the writer of the article "Egypt" in Smith's <i>Dictionary of the Bible</i>,
"2,735 square miles more [about 3,700 square statute miles] may have
been cultivated. In the best days of Egypt, probably all the land was
cultivated that could be made available for agricultural purposes, and
hence we may estimate the ancient arable area of that country at not less
than 11,000 square statute miles, or fully double its present extent."</p></div>

diminished by encroachment of the desert sands, or otherwise, but that, on
the contrary, it must have been increased since the age of the Pharaohs.
The Gotha <i>Almanac</i> for 1862 states the population of Egypt in 1859 at
5,125,000 souls; but this must be a great exaggeration, even supposing the
estimate to include the inhabitants of Nubia, and of much other territory
not geographically belonging to Egypt. In general, the population of that
country has been estimated at something more than three millions, or
about six hundred to the square mile; but with a better government and
better social institutions, the soil would sustain a much greater number,
and in fact it is believed that in ancient times its inhabitants were twice,
perhaps even thrice, as numerous as at present.
</p><p>
Wilkinson (<i>Handbook for Travellers in Egypt</i>, p. 10) observes that the
total population, which two hundred years ago was estimated at 4,000,000,
amounted till lately only to about 1,800,000 souls, having been reduced
since 1800 from 2,500,000 to that number.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_339_339" id="Footnote_339_339"></a><a href="#FNanchor_339_339"><span class="label">[339]</span></a> Ritter supposes Egypt to have been a sandy desert when it was first
occupied by man. "The first inhabitant of the sandy valley of the Nile was
a desert dweller, as his neighbors right and left, the Libyan, the nomade
Arab, still are. But the civilized people of Egypt transformed, by canals,
the waste into the richest granary of the world; they liberated themselves
from the shackles of the rock and sand desert, in the midst of which, by a
wise distribution of the fluid through the solid geographical form, by irrigation
in short, they created a region of culture most rich in historical
monuments."&mdash;<i>Einleitung zur allgemeinen vergleichenden Geographie</i>, pp.
165, 166.
</p><p>
This view seems to me highly improbable; for though, by canals and
embankments, man has done much to modify the natural distribution of
the waters of the Nile, and possibly has even transferred its channel from
one side of the valley to the other, yet the annual inundation is not his
work, and the river must have overflowed its banks and carried spontaneous
vegetation with its waters, as well before as since Egypt was first
occupied by the human family. There is, indeed, some reason to suppose
that man lived upon the banks of the Nile when its channel was much
lower, and the spread of its inundations much narrower than at present;
but wherever its flood reached, there the forest would propagate itself,
and its shores are much more likely to have been morasses than sands.</p></div>

just given allows eighty-one cubic m&egrave;tres per day to the hectare,
which, supposing the season of irrigation to be one hundred days, is equal
to a precipitation of thirty-two inches. But in Lombardy, water is applied
to some crops during a longer period than one hundred days; and in the
<i>marcite</i> it flows over the ground even in winter.
</p><p>
According to Boussingault (<i>&Eacute;conomie Rurale</i>, ii, p. 246) grass grounds
ought to receive, in Germany, twenty-one centim&egrave;tres of water per week,
and with less than half that quantity it is not advisable to incur the expense
of supplying it. The ground is irrigated twenty-five or thirty times, and
if the full quantity of twenty-one centim&egrave;tres is applied, it receives about
two hundred inches of water, or six times the total amount of precipitation.
Puvis, quoted by Boussingault, after much research comes to the conclusion
that a proper quantity is twenty centim&egrave;tres applied twenty-five or
thirty times, which corresponds with the estimate just stated. Puvis
adds&mdash;and, as our author thinks, with reason&mdash;that this amount might be
doubled without disadvantage.
</p><p>
Boussingault observes that rain water is vastly more fertilizing than the
water of irrigating canals, and therefore the supply of the latter must be
greater. This is explained partly by the different character of the substances
held in solution or suspension by the waters of the earth and of the
sky, partly by the higher temperature of the latter, and, possibly, partly
also by the mode of application&mdash;the rain being finely divided in its fall or
by striking plants on the ground, river water flowing in a continuous sheet.
</p><p>
The temperature of the water is thought even more important than its
composition. The sources which irrigate the <i>marcite</i> of Lombardy&mdash;meadows
so fertile that less than an acre furnishes grass for a cow the
whole year&mdash;are very warm. The ground watered by them never freezes,
and a first crop, for soiling, is cut from it in January or February. The
Canal Cavour, just now commenced&mdash;which is to take its supply from the
Po at Chivasso, fourteen or fifteen miles below Turin&mdash;will furnish water
of much higher fertilizing power than that derived from the Dora Baltea
and the Sesia, both because it is warmer, and because it transports a more
abundant and a richer sediment than the latter streams, which are fed by
Alpine icefields and melting snows, and which flow, for long distances, in
channels ground smooth and bare by ancient glaciers, and not now contributing
much vegetable mould or fine slime to their waters.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_343_343" id="Footnote_343_343"></a><a href="#FNanchor_343_343"><span class="label">[343]</span></a> It belongs rather to agriculture than to geography to discuss the
quality of the crops obtained by irrigation, or the permanent effects produced
by it on the productiveness of the soil. There is no doubt, however,
that all crops which can be raised without watering are superior in
flavor and in nutritive power to those grown by the aid of irrigation.
Garden vegetables, particularly, profusely watered, are so insipid as to be
hardly eatable. Wherever irrigation is practised, there is an almost irresistible
tendency, especially among ignorant cultivators, to carry it to
excess; and in Piedmont and Lombardy, if the supply of water is abundant,
it is so liberally applied as sometimes not only to injure the quality of the
product, but to drown the plants and diminish the actual weight of
the crop.
</p><p>
Professor Liebig, in his <i>Modern Agriculture</i>, says: "There is not to be
found in chemistry a more wonderful phenomenon, one which more confounds
all human wisdom, than is presented by the soil of a garden or field.
By the simplest experiment, any one may satisfy himself that rain water
filtered through field or garden soil does not dissolve out a trace of potash,
silicic acid, ammonia, or phosphoric acid. The soil does not give up to the
water one particle of the food of plants which it contains. The most continuous
rains cannot remove from the field, except mechanically, any of
the essential constituents of its fertility."
</p><p>
"The soil not only retains firmly all the food of plants which is actually
in it, but its power to preserve all that may be useful to them extends
much farther. If rain or other water holding in solution ammonia, potash,
and phosphoric and silicic acids, be brought in contact with soil, these
substances disappear almost immediately from the solution; the soil withdraws
them from the water. Only such substances are completely withdrawn
by the soil as are indispensable articles of food for plants; all others
remain wholly or in part in solution."
</p><p>
The first of the paragraphs just quoted is not in accordance with the
alleged experience of agriculturists in those parts of Italy where irrigation
is most successfully applied. They believe that the constituents of vegetable
growth are washed out of the soil by excessive and long-continued
watering. They consider it also established as a fact of observation, that
water which has flowed through or over rich ground is far more valuable
for irrigation than water from the same source, which has not been impregnated
with fertilizing substances by passing through soils containing
them; and, on the other hand, that water, rich in the elements of vegetation,
parts with them in serving to irrigate a poor soil, and is therefore
less valuable as a fertilizer of lower grounds to which it may afterward be
conducted.
</p><p>
The practice of irrigation&mdash;except in mountainous countries where
springs and rivulets are numerous&mdash;is attended with very serious economical,
social, and political evils. The construction of canals and their
immensely ramified branches, and the grading and scarping of the ground
to be watered, are always expensive operations, and they very often require
an amount of capital which can be commanded only by the state, by
moneyed corporations, or by very wealthy proprietors; the capacity of
the canals must be calculated with reference to the area intended to be
irrigated, and when they and their branches are once constructed, it is
very difficult to extend them, or to accommodate any of their original arrangements
to changes in the condition of the soil, or in the modes or
objects of cultivation; the flow of the water being limited by the abundance
of the source or the capacity of the canals, the individual proprietor
cannot be allowed to withdraw water at will, according to his own private
interest or convenience, but both the time and the quantity of supply must
be regulated by a general system applicable, as far as may be, to the whole
area irrigated by the same canal, and every cultivator must conform his
industry to a plan which may be quite at variance with his special objects
or with his views of good husbandry. The clashing interests and the
jealousies of proprietors depending on the same means of supply are a
source of incessant contention and litigation, and the caprices or partialities
of the officers who control, or of contractors who farm the canals,
lead not unfrequently to ruinous injustice toward individual landholders.
These circumstances discourage the division of the soil into small properties,
and there is a constant tendency to the accumulation of large estates
of irrigated land in the hands of great capitalists, and consequently to the
dispossession of the small cultivators, who pass from the condition of
owners of the land to that of hireling tillers. The farmers are no longer
yeomen, but peasants. Having no interest in the soil which composes
their country, they are virtually expatriated, and the middle class, which
ought to constitute the real physical and moral strength of the land, ceases
to exist as a rural estate, and is found only among the professional, the
mercantile, and the industrial population of the cities.</p></div>

In an elaborate paper on "Irrigation," printed in the <i>United States

into the Mediterranean by the Nile in twenty-four hours, at low water, is
150,566,392,368 cubic m&egrave;tres; at high water, 705,514,667,440 cubic m&egrave;tres.
Taking the mean of these two numbers, the average daily delivery of the
Nile would be 428,081,059,808 cubic m&egrave;tres, or more than 550,000,000,000
cubic yards. There is some enormous mistake, probably a typographical
error, in this statement, which makes the delivery of the Nile seventeen
hundred times as great as computed by Talabot, and many times more
than any physical geographer has ever estimated the quantity supplied by
all the rivers on the face of the globe.</p></div>

going on with great rapidity. New torrents were constantly forming, and
they were estimated to have covered more than 70,000 acres of good land,

very hard rock&mdash;as is the case in many of the valleys once filled by ancient
glaciers&mdash;and especially where they are fed by glaciers not overhung by
crumbling cliffs, the channel may remain almost unchanged for centuries.
This is observable in many of the tributaries of the Dora Baltea, which
drains the valley of the Aosta. Several of these small rivers are spanned
by more or less perfect Roman bridges&mdash;one of which, that over the Lys at
Pont St. Martin, is still in good repair and in constant use. An examination
of the rocks on which the abutments of this and some other similar structures
are founded, and of the channels of the rivers they cross, shows that
the beds of the streams cannot have been much elevated or depressed since
the bridges were built. In other cases, as at the outlet of the Val Tournanche
at Chatillon, where a single rib of a Roman bridge still remains, there is
nothing to forbid the supposition that the deep excavation of the channel
may have been partly effected at a much later period. See <i>App.</i>, <a href="#app_47">No. 47</a>.</p></div>

If the western coast of the Adriatic is undergoing a secular depression,
as many circumstances concur to prove, the sinking of the plain near the
coast may both tend to prevent the deposit of sediment in the river bed by
increasing the velocity of its current, and compensate the elevation really
produced by deposits, so that no sensible elevation would result, though
much gravel and slime might be let fall.</p></div>

to which it is subject, a dike or lev&eacute;e was built upon the bank of the river
and raised to an elevation above that of the highest known floods, and it
was connected, below the town, with grounds lying considerably above the
river. On one occasion a breach in the dike occurred above the town at
a very high stage of the flood. The water poured in behind it, and overflowed
the lower part of the city, which remained submerged for some
time after the river had retired to its ordinary level, because the dike,
which had been built to keep the water <i>out</i>, now kept it <i>in</i>.
</p><p>
According to Arthur Young, on the lower Po, where the surface of the
river has been elevated much above the level of the adjacent fields by
diking, the peasants in his time frequently endeavored to secure their
grounds against threatened devastation through the bursting of the dikes,
by crossing the river when the danger became imminent and opening a
cut in the opposite bank, thus saving their own property by flooding their
neighbors'. He adds, that at high water the navigation of the river was
absolutely interdicted, except to mail and passenger boats, and that the
guards fired upon all others; the object of the prohibition being to prevent
the peasants from resorting to this measure of self-defence.&mdash;<i>Travels in
Italy and Spain</i>, Nov. 7, 1789.
</p><p>
In a flood of the Po in 1839, a breach of the embankment took place at
Bonizzo. The water poured through and inundated 116,000 acres, or 181
square miles, of the plain, to the depth of from twenty to twenty-three feet
in its lower parts.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Baumgarten</span>, after <span class="smcap">Lombardini</span>, volume before cited,

flow of water is particularly noticed by Palissy in his essay on <i>Waters and
Fountains</i>, p. 173, edition of 1844. "There be," says he, "in divers parts
of France, and specially at Nantes, wooden bridges, where, to break the
force of the waters and of the floating ice, which might endamage the piers
of the said bridges, they have driven upright timbers into the bed of the
rivers above the said piers, without the which they should abide but little.
And in like wise, the trees which be planted along the mountains do much
deaden the violence of the waters that flow from them."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_367_367" id="Footnote_367_367"></a><a href="#FNanchor_367_367"><span class="label">[367]</span></a> I do not mean to say that all rivers excavate their own valleys, for I
have no doubt that in the majority of cases such depressions of the surface
originate in higher geological causes, and hence the valley makes the river,
not the river the valley. But even if we suppose a basin of the hardest rock
to be elevated at once, completely formed, from the submarine abyss where
it was fashioned, the first shower of rain that falls upon it after it rises to
the air, while its waters will follow the lowest lines of the surface, will
cut those lines deeper, and so on with every successive rain. The disintegrated
rock from the upper part of the basin forms the lower by alluvial
deposit, which is constantly transported farther and farther until the resistance
of gravitation and cohesion balances the mechanical force of the
running water. Thus plains, more or less steeply inclined, are formed, in
which the river is constantly changing its bed, according to the perpetually
varying force and direction of its currents, modified as they are by ever-fluctuating
conditions. Thus the Po is said to have long inclined to move
its channel southward in consequence of the superior mechanical force of
its northern affluents. A diversion of these tributaries from their present
beds, so that they should enter the main stream at other points and in different
directions, might modify the whole course of that great river. But
the mechanical force of the tributary is not the only element of its influence
on the course of the principal stream. The deposits it lodges in the
bed of the latter, acting as simple obstructions or causes of diversion, are
not less important agents of change.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_368_368" id="Footnote_368_368"></a><a href="#FNanchor_368_368"><span class="label">[368]</span></a> The distance to which a new obstruction to the flow of a river,
whether by a dam or by a deposit in its channel, will retard its current,
or, in popular phrase, "set back the water," is a problem of more difficult
practical solution than almost any other in hydraulics. The elements&mdash;such
as straightness or crookedness of channel, character of bottom and
banks, volume and previous velocity of current, mass of water far above
the obstruction, extraordinary drought or humidity of seasons, relative
extent to which the river may be affected by the precipitation in its own
basin, and by supplies received through subterranean channels from sources
so distant as to be exposed to very different meteorological influences, effects
of clearing and other improvements always going on in new countries&mdash;are
all extremely difficult, and some of them impossible, to be known and
measured. In the American States, very numerous watermills have been
erected within a few years, and there is scarcely a stream in the settled
portion of the country which has not several milldams upon it. When a
dam is raised&mdash;a process which the gradual diminution of the summer currents
renders frequently necessary&mdash;or when a new dam is built, it often
happens that the meadows above are flowed, or that the retardation of the
stream extends back to the dam next above. This leads to frequent lawsuits.
From the great uncertainty of the facts, the testimony is more conflicting
in these than in any other class of cases, and the obstinacy with
which "water causes" are disputed has become proverbial.
</p><p>
The subterranean courses of the waters form a subject very difficult of
investigation, and it is only recently that its vast importance has been
recognized. The interesting observations of Schmidt on the caves of the
Karst and their rivers throw much light on the underground hydrography
of limestone districts, and serve to explain how, in the low peninsula of
Florida, rivers, which must have their sources in mountains a hundred or
more miles distant, can pour out of the earth in currents large enough to
admit of steamboat navigation to their very basins of eruption. Artesian
wells are revealing to us the existence of subterranean lakes and rivers
sometimes superposed one above another in successive sheets; but the still
more important subject of the absorption of water by earth and its transmission
by infiltration is yet wrapped in great obscurity.</p></div>

delta, and converted them into comparatively dry land; but, on the other
hand, the retardation of the current from the lengthening of its course, and
the diminution of its velocity by the deposits at its mouth, have forced its
waters at some higher points to spread in spite of embankments, and thus
fertile fields have been turned into unhealthy and unproductive marshes.&mdash;See

or quality of the deposits of the Nile for forty or fifty, or, as some
compute, for a hundred centuries. From what vast store of rich earth
does this river derive the three or four inches of fertilizing material which
it spreads over the soil of Egypt every hundred years? Not from the
White Nile, for that river drops nearly all its suspended matter in the
broad expansions and slow current of its channel south of the tenth degree
of north latitude. Nor does it appear that much sediment is contributed
by the Bahr-el-Azrek, which flows through forests for a great part of its
course. I have been informed by an old European resident of Egypt who
is very familiar with the Upper Nile, that almost the whole of the earth

Lombardy was anciently covered with forests and morasses (Baumgarten,
l. c. p. 156); but, had the Po remained unconfined, its deposits would have
raised its banks as fast as its bed, and there is no obvious reason why this
plain should be more marshy than other alluvial flats traversed by great
rivers. Its lower course would possibly have become more marshy than
at present, but the banks of its middle and upper course would have been
in a better condition for agricultural use than they now are.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_372_372" id="Footnote_372_372"></a><a href="#FNanchor_372_372"><span class="label">[372]</span></a> From daily measurements during a period of fourteen years&mdash;1827 to
1840&mdash;the mean delivery of the Po at Ponte Lagoscuro, below the entrance

per second. Its smallest delivery is 186 cubic m&egrave;tres, or 6,569 cubic feet,
its greatest 5,156 cubic m&egrave;tres, or 182,094 cubic feet.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Baumgarten</span>, following
<span class="smcap">Lombardini</span>, volume before cited, p. 159.
</p><p>
The average delivery of the Nile being 101,000 cubic feet per second, it

the Nile to the Mediterranean&mdash;a result which will surprise most readers.</p></div>

occupied by man at least 5,000 years. The dates of Egyptian chronology

an already ancient civilization.</p></div>

few cases to exclude the waters of the inundation. Their office is to retain
the water received at high Nile into the inclosures formed by them until it
shall have deposited its sediment or been drawn out for irrigation; and
they serve also as causeways for interior communication during the floods.
The Egyptian dikes, therefore, instead of forcing the river, like those of
the Po, to transport its sediment to the sea, help to retain the slime, which,
if the flow of the current over the land were not obstructed, might be carried
back into the channel, and at last to the Mediterranean.</p></div>

and fifty miles in length. Two cubic miles of earth would more than
fill up the lagoons on the coast, and the remaining ten, even allowing the
mean depth of the water to be twenty fathoms, which is beyond the truth,
would have been sufficient to extend the coast line about three miles farther
seaward, and thus, including the land gained by the filling up of the
lagoons, to add more than five hundred square miles to the area of Egypt.
Nor is this all; for the retardation of the current, by lengthening the
course and consequently diminishing the inclination of the channel, would
have increased the deposit of suspended matter, and proportionally augmented
the total effect of the embankment.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_376_376" id="Footnote_376_376"></a><a href="#FNanchor_376_376"><span class="label">[376]</span></a> For the convenience of navigation, and to lessen the danger of inundation
by giving greater directness, and, of course, rapidity to the current,
bends in rivers are sometimes cut off and winding channels made straight.
This process has the same general effects as diking, and therefore cannot
be employed without many of the same results.
</p><p>
This practice has often been resorted to on the Mississippi with advantage
to navigation, but it is quite another question whether that advantage
has not been too dearly purchased by the injury to the banks at lower
points. If we suppose a river to have a navigable course of 1,600 miles
as measured by its natural channel, with a descent of 800 feet, we shall
have a fall of six inches to the mile. If the length of channel be reduced
to 1,200 miles by cutting off bends, the fall is increased to eight inches per
mile. The augmentation of velocity consequent upon this increase of inclination
is not computable without taking into account other elements,
such as depth and volume of water, diminution of direct resistance, and
the like, but in almost any supposable case, it would be sufficient to
produce great effects on the height of floods, the deposit of sediment in
the channel, on the shores, and at the outlet, the erosion of banks and
other points of much geographical importance.
</p><p>
The Po, in those parts of its course where the embankments leave
a wide space between, often cuts off bends in its channel and straightens
its course. These short cuts are called <i>salti</i>, or leaps, and sometimes
reduce the distance between their termini by several miles. In 1777, the
salto of Cottaro shortened a distance of 7,000 m&egrave;tres by 5,000, or, in other
words, reduced the length of the channel more than three miles; and in
1807 and 1810 the two salti of Mezzanone effected a reduction of distance
to the amount of between seven and eight miles.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Baumgarten</span>, l. c. p. 38.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_377_377" id="Footnote_377_377"></a><a href="#FNanchor_377_377"><span class="label">[377]</span></a> The fact, that the mixing of salt and fresh water in coast marshes and
lagoons is deleterious to the sanitary condition of the vicinity, seems almost
universally admitted, though the precise reason why a mixture of both
should be more injurious than either alone, is not altogether clear. It has
been suggested that the admission of salt water to the lagoons and rivers
kills many fresh water plants and animals, while the fresh water is equally
fatal to many marine organisms, and that the decomposition of the remains
originates poisonous miasmata. Other theories however have been proposed.
The whole subject is fully and ably discussed by Dr. Salvagnoli
Marchetti in the appendix to his valuable <i>Rapporto sul Bonificamento delle
Maremme Toscane</i>. See also the <i>Memorie Economico-Statistiche sulle Maremme
Toscane</i>, of the same author.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_378_378" id="Footnote_378_378"></a><a href="#FNanchor_378_378"><span class="label">[378]</span></a> This curious fact is thus stated in the preface to Fossombroni
(<i>Memorie sopra la Val di Chiana</i>, edition of 1835, p. xiii), from which
also I borrow most of the data hereafter given with respect to that valley:
"It is perhaps not universally known, that the swallows, which come from
the north [south] to spend the summer in our climate, do not frequent
marshy districts with a malarious atmosphere. A proof of the restoration
of salubrity in the Val di Chiana is furnished by these aerial visitors, which
had never before been seen in those low grounds, but which have appeared
within a few years at Forano and other points similarly situated."
</p><p>
Is the air of swamps destructive to the swallows, or is their absence in
such localities merely due to the want of human habitations, near which
this half-domestic bird loves to breed, perhaps because the house fly and
other insects which follow man are found only in the vicinity of his
dwellings?
</p><p>
In almost all European countries, the swallow is protected, by popular
opinion or superstition, from the persecution to which almost all other birds
are subject. It is possible that this respect for the swallow is founded
upon ancient observation of the fact just stated on the authority of Fossombroni.
Ignorance mistakes the effect for the cause, and the absence of
this bird may have been supposed to be the occasion, not the consequence,
of the unhealthiness of particular localities. This opinion once adopted,
the swallow would become a sacred bird, and in process of time fables and
legends would be invented to give additional sanction to the prejudices
which protected it. The Romans considered the swallow as consecrated
to the Penates, or household gods, and according to Peretti (<i>Le Serate del
Villaggio</i>, p. 168) the Lombard peasantry think it a sin to kill them, because
they are <i>le gallinelle del Signore</i>, the chickens of the Lord.
</p><p>
The following little Tuscan <i>rispetto</i> from Gradi (<i>Racconti Popolari</i>, p.
33) well expresses the feeling of the peasantry toward this bird:
</p><p class="poem">
O rondinella che passi lo mare<br />
Torna 'ndietro, vo' dirti du' parole;<br />
Dammi 'na penna delle tue bell' ale,<br />
Vo' scrivere 'na lettera al mi' amore;<br />
E quando l' avr&ograve; scritta 'n carta bella,<br />
Ti render&ograve; la penna, o rondinella;<br />
E quando l' avr&ograve; scritta 'n carta bianca,<br />
Ti render&ograve; la penna che ti manca;<br />
E quando l' avr&ograve; scritta in carta d' oro,<br />
Ti render&ograve; la penna al tuo bel volo.<br />
<br />
O swallow, that fliest beyond the sea,<br />
Turn back! I would fain have a word with thee.<br />
A feather oh grant, from thy wing so bright!<br />
For I to my sweetheart a letter would write;<br />
And when it is written on paper fine<br />
I'll give thee, O swallow, that feather of thine;<br />
&mdash;On paper so white, and I'll give thee back,<br />
O pretty swallow, the pen thou dost lack;<br />
&mdash;On paper of gold, and then I'll restore<br />
To thy beautiful pinion the feather once more.<br />
</p><p>
Popular traditions and superstitions are so closely connected with localities,
that, though an emigrant people may carry them to a foreign land,
they seldom survive a second generation. The swallow, however, is still
protected in New England by prejudices of transatlantic origin; and I
remember hearing, in my childhood, that if the swallows were killed, the
cows would give bloody milk.</p></div>

Maremma, the Pecora, by clearings recently executed along its upper
course. "The condition of this marsh and of its affluents are now, November,
1859, much changed, and it is advisable to prosecute its improvement
by deposits. In consequence of the extensive felling of the woods
upon the plains, hills, and mountains of the territory of Massa and Scarlino,
within the last ten years, the Pecora and other affluents of the marsh
receive, during the rains, water abundantly charged with slime, so that
the deposits within the first division of the marsh are already considerable,
and we may now hope to see the whole marsh and pond filled up in a much
shorter time than we had a right to expect before 1850. This circumstance
totally changes the terms of the question, because the filling of the marsh
and pond, which then seemed almost impossible on account of the small

diet at certain seasons, and as fish is not flesh, there is a great demand for
that article of food at those periods. For the convenience of monasteries
and their patrons, and as a source of pecuniary emolument to ecclesiastical
establishments and sometimes to lay proprietors, great numbers of artificial
fish ponds were created during the Middle Ages. They were generally
shallow pools formed by damming up the outlet of marshes, and they were
among the most fruitful sources of endemic disease, and of the peculiar
malignity of the epidemics which so often ravaged Europe in those centuries.
These ponds, in religious hands, were too sacred to be infringed
upon for sanitary purposes, and when belonging to powerful lay lords they
were almost as inviolable. The rights of fishery were a standing obstacle
to every proposal of hydraulic improvement, and to this day large and
fertile districts in Southern Europe remain sickly and almost unimproved
and uninhabited, because the draining of the ponds upon them would
reduce the income of proprietors who derive large profits by supplying the

in short, tend to raise their own beds; those charged only with fine, light
earth, to cut them deeper. The prairie rivers of the West have deep
channels, because the mineral matter they carry down is not heavy enough
to resist the impulse of even a moderate current, and those tributaries of
the Po which deposit their sediment in the lakes&mdash;the Ticino, the Adda,

only lets it fall where the force of the current becomes weakened. This
explains the continual advance of the land seaward along the Syrian coast,
in consequence of which Tyre and Sidon no longer lie on the shore, but
some distance inland. That the Nile contributes to this deposit may easily
be seen, even by the unscientific observer, from the stained and turbid
character of the water for many miles from its mouths. A somewhat
alarming phenomenon was observed in this neighborhood in 1801, on board
the English frigate Romulus, Captain Culverhouse, on a voyage from Acre
to Abukir. Dr. E. D. Clarke, who was a passenger on board this ship,
thus describes it:
</p><p>
"'26th July.&mdash;To-day, Sunday, we accompanied the captain to the
wardroom to dine, as usual, with his officers. While we were at table,
we heard the sailors who were throwing the lead suddenly cry out:
"Three and a half!" The captain sprang up, was on deck in an instant,
and, almost at the same moment, the ship slackened her way, and veered
about. Every sailor on board supposed she would ground at once. Meanwhile,
however, as the ship came round, the whole surface of the water
was seen to be covered with thick, black mud, which extended so far that
it appeared like an island. At the same time, actual land was nowhere to
be seen&mdash;not even from the masthead&mdash;nor was any notice of such a shoal
to be found on any chart on board. The fact is, as we learned afterward,
that a stratum of mud, stretching from the mouths of the Nile for many
miles out into the open sea, forms a movable deposit along the Egyptian
coast. If this deposit is driven forward by powerful currents, it sometimes
rises to the surface, and disturbs the mariner by the sudden appearance
of shoals where the charts lead him to expect a considerable depth
of water. But these strata of mud are, in reality, not in the least dangerous.
As soon as a ship strikes them they break up at once, and a frigate may
hold her course in perfect safety where an inexperienced pilot, misled by
his soundings, would every moment expect to be stranded.'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">B&ouml;ttger</span>,

the earth, which cannot, in all cases, be identified with streams flowing out
of them at other points, and like phenomena are not uncommon in other
limestone countries.
</p><p>
The cases are certainly not numerous where marine currents are known
to pour continuously into cavities beneath the surface of the earth, but
there is at least one well-authenticated instance of this sort&mdash;that of the
mill streams at Argostoli in the island of Cephalonia. It had been long
observed that the sea water flowed into several rifts and cavities in the
limestone rocks of the coast, but the phenomenon has excited little attention
until very recently. In 1833, three of the entrances were closed, and
a regular channel, sixteen feet long and three feet wide, with a fall of three
feet, was cut into the mouth of a larger cavity. The sea water flowed into
this canal, and could be followed eighteen or twenty feet beyond its inner
terminus, when it disappeared in holes and clefts in the rock.
</p><p>
In 1858, the canal had been enlarged to the width of five feet and a
half, and a depth of a foot. The water pours rapidly through the canal
into an irregular depression and forms a pool, the surface of which is three
or four feet below the adjacent soil, and about two and a half or three feet
below the level of the sea. From this pool it escapes through several
holes and clefts in the rock, and has not yet been found to emerge elsewhere.
</p><p>
There is a tide at Argostoli of about six inches in still weather, but it is
considerably higher with a south wind. I do not find it stated whether
water flows through the canal into the cavity at low tide, but it distinctly
appears that there is no refluent current, as of course there could not be
from a basin so much below the sea. Mousson found the delivery through
the canal to be at the rate of 24.88 cubic feet to the second; at what stage
of the tide does not appear. Other mills of the same sort have been
erected, and there appear to be several points on the coast where the sea
flows into the land.
</p><p>
Various hypotheses have been suggested to explain this phenomenon,
some of which assume that the water descends to a great depth beneath
the crust of the earth, but the supposition of a difference of level in the
surface of the sea on the opposite sides of the island, which seems confirmed
by other circumstances, is the most obvious method of explaining
these singular facts. If we suppose the level of the water on one side of
the island to be raised by the action of currents three or four feet higher
than on the other, the existence of cavities and channels in the rock would
easily account for a subterranean current beneath the island, and the apertures
of escape might be so deep or so small as to elude observation. See

that the augmentation of the volume of that river must be ascribed
principally to springs rising in its bed. This is a point of which engineers
now take notice, and M. Belgrand, the able officer charged with the improvement
of the navigation of the Seine between Paris and Rouen, has
devoted much attention to it."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Babinet</span>, <i>&Eacute;tudes et Lectures</i>, iii, p. 185.
</p><p>
On page 232 of the volume just quoted, the same author observes: "In
the lower part of its course, from the falls of the Oise, the Seine receives
so few important affluents, that evaporation alone would suffice to exhaust
all the water which passes under the bridges of Paris."
</p><p>
This supposes a much greater amount of evaporation than has been
usually computed, but I believe it is well settled that the Seine conveys to
the sea much more water than is discharged into it by all its superficial
branches.</p></div>

This opinion, if locally true, cannot be generally so, for it is inconsistent

Laurent, (<i>M&eacute;moires sur le Sahara Oriental</i>, pp. 8, 9), in speaking of a
river at El-Faid, "which, like all those of the desert, is, most of the time,
without water," observes, that many wells are dug in the bed of the river
in the dry season, and that the subterranean current thus reached appears
to extend itself laterally, at about the same level, at least a kilom&egrave;tre from
the river, as water is found by digging to the depth of twelve or fifteen
m&egrave;tres at a village situated at that distance from the bank.
</p><p>
The most remarkable case of infiltration known to me by personal
observation is the occurrence of fresh water in the beach sand on the
eastern side of the Gulf of Akaba, the eastern arm of the Red Sea. If you
dig a cavity in the beach near the sea level, it soon fills with water so fresh
as not to be undrinkable, though the sea water two or three yards from it
contains even more than the average quantity of salt. It cannot be maintained
that this is sea water freshened by filtration through a few feet or
inches of sand, for salt water cannot be deprived of its salt by that process.
It can only come from the highlands of Arabia, and it would seem that
there must exist some large reservoir in the interior to furnish a supply
which, in spite of evaporation, holds out for months after the last rains of
winter, and perhaps even through the year. I observed the fact in the
month of June.
</p><p>
The precipitation in the mountains that border the Red Sea is not
known by pluviometric measurement, but the mass of debris brought
down the ravines by the torrents proves that their volume must be large.
The proportion of surface covered by sand and absorbent earth, in Arabia
Petr&aelig;a and the neighboring countries, is small, and the mountains drain
themselves rapidly into the wadies or ravines where the torrents are
formed; but the beds of earth and disintegrated rock at the bottom of the
valleys are of so loose and porous texture, that a great quantity of water
is absorbed in saturating them before a visible current is formed on their
surface. In a heavy thunder storm, accompanied by a deluging rain,
which I witnessed at Mount Sinai in the month of May, a large stream of
water poured, in an almost continuous cascade, down the steep ravine
north of the convent, by which travellers sometimes descend from the
plateau between the two peaks, but after reaching the foot of the mountain,
it flowed but a few yards before it was swallowed up in the sands.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_400_400" id="Footnote_400_400"></a><a href="#FNanchor_400_400"><span class="label">[400]</span></a> It is conceivable that in large and shallow subterranean basins the
superincumbent earth may rest upon the water and be partly supported by
it. In such case the weight of the earth would be an additional, if not the
sole, cause of the ascent of the water through the tubes of artesian wells.
The elasticity of gases in the cavities may also aid in forcing up water.
</p><p>
A French engineer, M. Mullot, invented a simple method of bringing
to the surface water from any one of several successive accumulations at
different depths, or of raising it, unmixed, from two or more of them at
once. It consists in employing concentric tubes, one within the other,
leaving a space for the rise of water between them, and reaching each to
the sheet from which it is intended to draw.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_401_401" id="Footnote_401_401"></a><a href="#FNanchor_401_401"><span class="label">[401]</span></a> Many more or less probable conjectures have been made on this subject,
but thus far I am not aware that any of the apprehended results have
been actually shown to have happened. In an article in the <i>Annales des
Ponts et Chauss&eacute;es</i> for July and August, 1839, p. 131, it was suggested that
the sinking of the piers of a bridge at Tours in France was occasioned by
the abstraction of water from the earth by artesian wells, and the consequent
withdrawal of the mechanical support it had previously given to the
strata containing it. A reply to this article will be found in <span class="smcap">Violett</span>,
<i>Th&eacute;orie des Puits Art&eacute;siens</i>, p. 217.
</p><p>
In some instances the water has rushed up with a force which seemed
to threaten the inundation of the neighborhood, and even the washing
away of much soil; but in those cases the partial exhaustion of the supply,
or the relief of hydrostatic or elastic pressure, has generally produced a
diminution of the flow in a short time, and I do not know that any serious
evil has ever been occasioned in this way.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_402_402" id="Footnote_402_402"></a><a href="#FNanchor_402_402"><span class="label">[402]</span></a> See a very interesting account of these wells, and of the workmen
who clean them out when obstructed by sand brought up with the water,
in Laurent's memoir on the artesian wells recently bored by the French
Government in the Algerian desert, <i>M&eacute;moire sur le Sahara Oriental, etc.</i>,
pp. 19, <i>et seqq.</i> Some of the men remained under water from two minutes
to two minutes and forty seconds. Several officers are quoted as having
observed immersions of three minutes' duration, and M. Berbrugger alleges
that he witnessed one of five minutes and fifty-five seconds. The shortest
of these periods is longer than the best pearl diver can remain below the
surface of salt water. The wells of the Sahara are from twenty to eighty
m&egrave;tres deep.
</p><p>
It has often been asserted that the ancient Egyptians were acquainted
with the art of boring artesian wells. Parthey, describing the Little Oasis,
mentions ruins of a Roman aqueduct, and observes: "It appears from the
recent researches of Aim, a French engineer, that these aqueducts are connected
with old artesian wells, the restoration of which would render it
practicable to extend cultivation much beyond its present limits. This
agrees with ancient testimony. It is asserted that the inhabitants of the
oases sunk wells to the depth of 200, 300, and even 500 ells, from which
affluent streams of water poured out. See <span class="smcap">Olympiodorus</span> in <i>Photii Bibl.</i>,

In a paper entitled, <i>Note relative &agrave; l'execution d'un Puits Art&eacute;sien en
Egypte sous la XVIII dynastie</i>, presented to the Acad&eacute;mie des Inscriptions
et Belles Lettres, on the 12th of November, 1852, M. Lenormant endeavors
to show that a hieroglyphic inscription found at Contrapscelcis
proves the execution of a work of this sort in the Nubian desert, at the
period indicated in the title to his paper. The interpretation of the inscription
is a question for Egyptologists; but if wells were actually bored
through the rock by the Egyptians after the Chinese or the European
fashion, it is singular that among the numerous and minute representations of
their industrial operations, painted or carved on the walls of
their tombs, no trace of the processes employed for so remarkable and important
a purpose should have been discovered. See <i>Appendix</i>, <a href="#app_56">No. 56</a>.
</p><p>
It is certain that artesian wells have been common in China from a
very remote antiquity, and the simple method used by the Chinese&mdash;where
the borer is raised and let fall by a rope, instead of a rigid rod&mdash;has been
lately been employed in Europe with advantage. Some of the Chinese
wells are said to be 3,000 feet deep; that of Neusalzwerk in Silesia&mdash;the
deepest in Europe&mdash;is 2,300. A well was bored at St. Louis, in Missouri,
a few years ago, to supply a sugar refinery, to the depth of 2,199 feet.
This was executed by a private firm in three years, at the expense of only
$10,000. Another has since been bored at the State capitol at Columbus,
Ohio, 2,500 feet deep, but without obtaining the desired supply of water.</p></div>

think, one of the phenomena which most surprise and interest a stranger
to those regions. In England and the United States, rock is so generally
covered with moss or earth, and earth with vegetation, that untravelled
Englishmen and Americans are not very familiar with naked rock as a conspicuous
element of landscape. Hence, in their conception of a bare cliff
or precipice, they hardly ascribe definite color to it, but depict it to their
imagination as wearing a neutral tint not assimilable to any of the hues
with which nature tinges her atmospheric or paints her organic creations.
There are certainly extensive desert ranges, chiefly limestone formations,
where the surface is either white, or has weathered down to a dull uniformity
of tone which can hardly be called color at all; and there are
sand plains and drifting hills of wearisome monotony of tint. But the
chemistry of the air, though it may tame the glitter of the limestone to a
dusky gray, brings out the green and brown and purple of the igneous
rocks, and the white and red and blue and violet and yellow of the sandstone.
Many a cliff in Arabia Petr&aelig;a is as manifold in color as the rainbow,
and the veins are so variable in thickness and inclination, so contorted
and involved in arrangement, as to bewilder the eye of the spectator like a
disk of party-colored glass in rapid revolution.
</p><p>
In the narrower wadies, the mirage is not common; but on broad expanses,
as at many points between Cairo and Suez, and in Wadi el Araba,
it mocks you with lakes and land-locked bays, studded with islands and
fringed with trees, all painted with an illusory truth of representation
absolutely indistinguishable from the reality. The checkered earth, too, is
canopied with a heaven as variegated as itself. You see, high up in the
sky, rosy clouds at noonday, colored probably by reflection from the ruddy
mountains, while near the horizon float cumuli of a transparent ethereal
blue, seemingly balled up out of the clear cerulean substance of the firmament,
and detached from the heavenly vault, not by color or consistence,
but solely by the light and shade of their prominences.</p></div>

sensibly in specific gravity or in texture; and the singular way in which
they are now alternated, now confusedly intermixed, must be explained
otherwise than by the weight of the respective grains which compose
them. They seem, in fact, to have been let fall by water in violent ebullition
or tumultuous mechanical agitation, or by a succession of sudden
aquatic or aerial currents flowing in different directions and charged with
differently colored matter.</p></div>

than two hundred and twenty cubic feet to the running foot. Laval, upon

rock, by causes now in action, are perhaps nowhere more perfectly realized
than in the Sinaitic Peninsula. The mountains are steep and lofty, unprotected
by vegetation or even by a coating of earth, and the rocks which
compose them are in a shattered and fragmentary condition. They are
furrowed by deep and precipitous ravines, with beds sufficiently inclined
for the rapid flow of water, and generally without basins in which the
larger blocks of stone rolled by the torrents can be dropped and left in
repose; there are severe frosts and much snow on the higher summits and
ridges, and the winter rains are abundant and heavy. The mountains are
principally of igneous formation, but many of the less elevated peaks are
capped with sandstone, and on the eastern slope of the peninsula you may
sometimes see, at a single glance, several lofty pyramids of granite, separated
by considerable intervals, and all surmounted by horizontally stratified
deposits of sandstone often only a few yards square, which correspond
to each other in height, are evidently contemporaneous in origin, and were
once connected in continuous beds. The degradation of the rock on which
this formation rests is constantly bringing down masses of it, and mingling
them with the basaltic, porphyritic, granitic, and calcareous fragments
which the torrents carry down to the valleys, and, through them, in a
state of greater or less disintegration, to the sea. The quantity of sand
annually washed into the Red Sea by the larger torrents of the Lesser
Peninsula, is probably at least equal to that contributed to the ocean by
any streams draining basins of no greater extent. Absolutely considered,
then, the mass may be said to be large, but it is apparently very small as
compared with the sand thrown up by the German Ocean and the Atlantic
on the coasts of Denmark and of France. There are, indeed, in Arabia
Petr&aelig;a, many torrents with very short courses, for the sea waves in many
parts of the peninsular coast wash the base of the mountains. In these
cases, the debris of the rocks do not reach the sea in a sufficiently comminuted
condition to be entitled to the appellation of sand, or even in the
form of well-rounded pebbles. The fragments retain their angular shape,
and, at some points on the coast, they become cemented together by lime
or other binding substances held in solution or mechanical suspension in
the sea water, and are so rapidly converted into a singularly heterogeneous
conglomerate, that one deposit seems to be consolidated into a breccia
before the next winter's torrents cover it with another.
</p><p>
In the northern part of the peninsula there are extensive deposits of
sand intermingled with agate pebbles and petrified wood, but these are
evidently neither derived from the Sinaitic group, nor products of local
causes known to be now in action.
</p><p>
I may here notice the often repeated but mistaken assertion, that the
petrified wood of the Western Arabian desert consists wholly of the stems
of palms, or at least of endogenous vegetables. This is an error. I have
myself picked up in that desert, within the space of a very few square
yards, fragments both of fossil palms, and of at least two petrified trees
distinctly marked as of exogenous growth both by annular structure and
by knots. In ligneous character, one of these almost precisely resembles
the grain of the extant beech, and this specimen was wormeaten before it
was converted into silex.</p></div>

as might be expected from the infinite variety of conditions by
which the movement of water is affected. It is generally believed that
the action of the wind upon the water is not perceptible at greater depths
than from fifteen feet in ordinary, to eighty or ninety in extreme cases;
but these estimates are probably very considerably below the truth. Andresen
quotes Br&eacute;montier as stating that the movement of the waves sometimes
extends to the depth of five hundred feet, and he adds that others
think it may reach to six or even seven hundred feet below the surface.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Andresen</span>,
<i>Om Klitformationen</i>, p. 20.
</p><p>
Many physicists now suppose that the undulations of great bodies of
water reach even deeper. But a movement of undulation is not necessarily
a movement of translation, and besides, there is very frequently an
undertow, which tends to carry suspended bodies out to sea as powerfully
as the superficial waves to throw them on shore. Sandbanks sometimes
recede from the coast, instead of rolling toward it. Reclus informs us
that the Mauvaise, a sandbank near the Point de Grave, on the Atlantic
coast of France, has moved five miles to the west in less than a century.&mdash;<i>Revue
des Deux Mondes</i>, for December, 1862, p. 905.
</p><p>
The action of currents may, in some cases, have been confounded with
that of the waves. Sea currents, strong enough, possibly, to transport
sand for some distance, flow far below the surface in parts of the open
ocean, and in narrow straits they have great force and velocity. The
divers employed at Constantinople in 1853 found in the Bosphorus, at the
depth of twenty-five fathoms and at a point much exposed to the wash
from Galata and Pera, a number of bronze guns supposed to have belonged
to a ship of war blown up about a hundred and fifty years before. These
guns were not covered by sand or slime, though a crust of earthy matter,
an inch in thickness, adhered to their upper surfaces, and the bottom of the
strait appeared to be wholly free from sediment. The current was so powerful
at this depth that the divers were hardly able to stand, and a keg of
nails, purposely dropped into the water, in order that its movements might
serve as a guide in the search for a bag of coin accidentally lost overboard
from a ship in the harbor, was rolled by the stream several hundred yards
before it stopped.</p></div>

Ocean; but there is some reason to think that the amount of this material
now cast upon its northern shores is less than at some former periods,
though no extensive series of observations on this subject has been recorded.
On the Spit of Agger, at the present outlet of the Liimfjord,
Andresen found the quantity during ten years, on a beach about five hundred
and seventy feet broad, equal to an annual deposit of an inch and a
half over the whole surface.&mdash;<i>Om Klitformationen</i>, p. 56.
</p><p>
This gives seventy-one and a quarter cubic feet to the running foot&mdash;a
quantity certainly much smaller than that cast up by the same sea on the
shores of the Dano-German duchies and of Holland, and, as we have
seen, scarcely one fourth of that deposited by the Atlantic on the coast of
Gascony. See <i>ante</i>, p. 453, note.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_416_416" id="Footnote_416_416"></a><a href="#FNanchor_416_416"><span class="label">[416]</span></a> Sand heaps, three and even six hundred feet high, are indeed formed
by the wind, but this is effected by driving the particles up an inclined
plane, not by lifting them. Br&eacute;montier, speaking of the sand hills on the
western coast of France, says: "The particles of sand composing them
are not large enough to resist wind of a certain force, nor small enough to
be taken up by it, like dust; they only roll along the surface from which
they are detached, and, though moving with great velocity, they rarely
rise to a greater height than three or four inches."&mdash;<i>M&eacute;moire sur les Dunes,
Annales des Ponts et Chauss&eacute;es</i>, 1833, 1er s&eacute;mestre, p. 148.
</p><p>
Andresen says that a wind, having a velocity of forty feet per second,
is strong enough to raise particles of sand as high as the face and eyes of a
man, but that, in general, it rolls along the ground, and is scarcely ever
thrown more than to the height of a couple of yards from the surface.
Even in these cases, it is carried forward by a hopping, not a continuous,
motion; for a very narrow sheet or channel of water stops the drift entirely,
all the sand dropping into it until it is filled up.
</p><p>
The character of the motion of sand drifts is well illustrated by an interesting
fact not much noticed hitherto by travellers in the East. In
situations where the sand is driven through depressions in rock beds, or
over deposits of silicious pebbles, the surface of the stone is worn and
smoothed much more effectually than it could be by running water, and
you may pick up, in such localities, rounded, irregularly broken fragments
of agate, which have received from the attrition of the sand as fine a polish
as could be given them by the wheel of the lapidary.
</p><p>
Very interesting observations on the polishing of hard stones by drifting
sand will be found in the Geological Report of William P. Blake: <i>Pacific
Railroad Report</i>, vol. v, pp. 92, 230, 231. The same geologist observes,
p. 242, that the sand of the Colorado desert does not rise high in the air,
but bounds along on the surface or only a few inches above it.</p></div>

the Libyan desert, and much inquiry of the best native sources, he never
saw or heard of any instance of danger to man or beast from the mere
accumulation of sand transported by the wind. Chesney's observations in
Arabia, and the testimony of the Bedouins he consulted, are to the same
purpose. The dangers of the simoom are of a different character, though
they are certainly aggravated by the blinding effects of the light particles
of dust and sand borne along by it, and by that of the inhalation of them
upon the respiration.</p></div>

advance of sand dunes which threaten to overwhelm villages. "At Debila,"
says Laurent, "the lower parts of the lofty dunes are planted with palms,
* * * but they are constantly menaced with burial by the sands. The
only remedy employed by the natives consists in little dry walls of crystallized
gypsum, built on the crests of the dunes, together with hedges of
dead palm leaves. These defensive measures are aided by incessant labor;
for every day the people take up in baskets the sand blown over to them
the night before and carry it back to the other side of the dune."&mdash;<i>M&eacute;moires

calcareous exuvi&aelig; of infusorial animals and plants, are sometimes found
mingled in considerable quantities with mineral sands. These are usually
the remains of aquatic vegetables or animals, but not uniformly so, for the
microscopic organisms, whose flinty cases enter so largely into the sandbeds
of the Mark of Brandenburg, are still living and prolific in the dry
earth. See <span class="smcap">Wittwer</span>, <i>Physikalische Geographie</i>, p. 142.
</p><p>
The desert on both sides of the Nile is inhabited by a land snail, and
thousands of its shells are swept along and finally buried in the drifts by
every wind. Every handful of the sand contains fragments of them.
<span class="smcap">Forchhammer</span>, in <span class="smcap">Leonhard</span> Und <span class="smcap">Bronn</span>'s <i>Jahrbuch</i>, 1841, p. 8, says of the
sand hills of the Danish coast: "It is not rare to find, high in the knolls,
marine shells, and especially those of the oyster. They are due to the
oyster eater [<i>H&aelig;malopus ostralegus</i>], which carries his prey to the top of
the dunes to devour it." See also <span class="smcap">Staring</span>, <i>De Bodem van</i>, N. I. p. 321.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_422_422" id="Footnote_422_422"></a><a href="#FNanchor_422_422"><span class="label">[422]</span></a> There are various reasons why the formation of dunes is confined to
low shores, and this law is so universal, that when bluffs are surmounted
by them, there is always cause to suspect upheaval, or the removal of a
sloping beach in front of the bluff, after the dunes were formed. Bold
shores are usually without a sufficient beach for the accumulation of large
deposits; they are commonly washed by a sea too deep to bring up sand
from its bottom; their abrupt elevation, even if moderate in amount,
would still be too great to allow ordinary winds to lift the sand above
them; and their influence in deadening the wind which blows toward
them would even more effectually prevent the raising of sand from the
beach at their foot.
</p><p>
Forchhammer, describing the coast of Jutland, says that, in high winds,
"one can hardly stand upon the dunes, except when they are near the
water line and have been cut down perpendicularly by the waves. Then
the wind is little or not at all felt&mdash;a fact of experience very common on
our coasts, observed on all the steep shore bluffs of two hundred feet in
height, and, in the Faroe Islands, on precipices two thousand feet high. In
heavy gales in those islands, the cattle fly to the very edge of the cliffs for
shelter, and frequently fall over. The wind, impinging against the vertical
wall, creates an ascending current which shoots somewhat past the crest
of the rock, and thus the observer or the animal is protected against the
tempest by a barrier of air."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Leonhard</span> und <span class="smcap">Bronn</span>, <i>Jahrbuch</i>, 1841, p. 3.
</p><p>
The calming, or rather diversion, of the wind by cliffs extends to a considerable
distance in front of them, and no wind would have sufficient
force to raise the sand vertically, parallel to the face of a bluff, even to the
height of twenty feet.
</p><p>
It is very commonly believed that it is impossible to grow forest trees
on sea-shore bluffs, or points much exposed to strong winds. The observations
just cited tend to show that it would not be difficult to protect trees
from the mechanical effect of the wind, by screens much lower than the
height to which they are expected to grow. Recent experiments confirm
this, and it is found that, though the outer row or rows may suffer from
the wind, every tree shelters a taller one behind it. Extensive groves have
thus been formed in situations where an isolated tree would not grow at all.
</p><p>
Piper, in his <i>Trees of America</i>, p. 19, gives an interesting account of Mr.
Tudor's success in planting trees on the bleak and barren shore of Nahant.
"Mr. Tudor," observes he, "has planted more than ten thousand trees at
Nahant, and, by the results of his experiments, has fully demonstrated that
trees, properly cared for in the beginning, may be made to grow up to the
very bounds of the ocean, exposed to the biting of the wind and the spray
of the sea. The only shelter they require is, at first, some interruption to
break the current of the wind, such as fences, houses, or other trees."</p></div>

Upon the summits, one seldom needs to dig more than a foot to find
the sand moist, and in the depressions, fresh water is met with near the
surface."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Forchhammer</span>, in <span class="smcap">Leonhard</span> und <span class="smcap">Bronn</span>, for 1841, p. 5, note.
</p><p>
On the other hand, Andresen, who has very carefully investigated this
as well as all other dune phenomena, maintains that the humidity of the
sand ridges cannot be derived from capillary attraction. He found by
experiment that drift sand was not moistened to a greater height than
eight and a half inches, after standing a whole night in water. He
states the minimum of water contained by the sand of the dunes, one foot
below the surface, after a long drought, at two per cent., the maximum,
after a rainy month, at four per cent. At greater depths the quantity is
larger. The hygroscopicity of the sand of the coast of Jutland he found
to be thirty-three per cent. by measure, or 21.5 by weight. The annual
precipitation on that coast is twenty-seven inches, and, as the evaporation
is about the same, he argues that rain water does not penetrate far beneath
the surface of the dunes, and concludes that their humidity can be explained
only by evaporation from below.&mdash;<i>Om Klitformationen</i>, pp. 106-110.
</p><p>
In the dunes of Algeria, water is so abundant that wells are constantly
dug in them at high points on their surface. They are sunk to the depth
of three or four m&egrave;tres only, and the water rises to the height of a m&egrave;tre
in them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Laurent</span>, <i>M&eacute;moire sur le Sahara</i>, pp. 11, 12, 13.
</p><p>
The same writer observes (p. 14) that the hollows in the dunes are
planted with palms which find moisture enough a little below the surface.
It would hence seem that the proposal to fix the dunes which are supposed
to threaten the Suez Canal, by planting the maritime pine and other trees
upon them, is not altogether so absurd as it is thought to be by some of
those disinterested philanthropists of other nations who are distressed with
fears that French capitalists will lose the money they have invested in that
great undertaking.

always composed of quartzose sand. "The dune sands" of different
characters, says Br&eacute;montier, "partake of the nature of the different materials
which compose them. At certain points on the coast of Normandy
they are found to be purely calcareous; they are of mixed composition on
the shores of Brittany and Saintonge, and generally quartzose between the
mouth of the Gironde and that of the Adour."&mdash;<i>M&eacute;moire sur les Dunes,

"In the sand-hill ponds mentioned in the text, there is a vigorous
growth of bog plants accompanied with the formation of peat, which goes
on regularly as long as the dune sand does not drift. But if the surface of
the dunes is broken, the sand blows into the ponds, covers the peat, and
puts an end to its formation. When, in the course of time, marine currents
cut away the coast, the dunes move landward and fill up the ponds, and
thus are formed the remarkable strata of fossile peat called Mart&ouml;rv, which
appears to be unknown to the geologists of other parts of Europe."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Forchhammer</span>,

says: "But I am not able to point out a sandstone formation corresponding
to the dunes. Probably most ancient dunes have been destroyed by

Such formations, however, certainly exist. I find from Laurent (<i>M&eacute;moire
sur le Sahara, etc.</i>, p. 12), that in the Algerian desert there exist
"sandstone formations" not only "corresponding to the dunes," but actually
consolidated within them. "A place called El-Mouia-Tadjer presents
a repetition of what we saw at El-Baya; one of the funnels formed
in the middle of the dunes contains wells from two m&egrave;tres to two and a
half in depth, dug in a sand which pressure, and probably the presence of
certain salts, have cemented so as to form true sandstone, soft indeed, but
which does not yield except to the pickaxe. These sandstones exhibit an
inclination which seems to be the effect of wind; for they conform to the
direction of the sands which roll down a scarp occasioned by the primitive
obstacle." See <i>Appendix</i>, <a href="#app_59">No. 59</a>.

The dunes near the mouth of the Nile, the lower sands of which have
been cemented together by the infiltration of Nile water, would probably
show a similar stratification in the sandstone which now forms their base.</p></div>

dune sands and the beach ripples, not to the similarity of the effect of wind
and water upon sand, but wholly to the action of the former fluid; in the
first instance, directly, in the latter, through the water. "The wind ripples
on the surface of the dunes precisely resemble the water ripples of
sand flats occasionally overflowed by the sea; and with the closest scrutiny,
I have never been able to detect the slightest difference between them.
This is easily explained by the fact, that the water ripples are produced by
the action of light wind on the water which only transmits the air waves
to the sand."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Leonhard</span> und <span class="smcap">Bronn</span>, 1841, pp. 7, 8.</p></div>

character of the sand grains which compose the interior dunes of the North
American desert. C. C. Parry, geologist to the Mexican Boundary Commission,
in describing the dunes near the station at a spring thirty-two
miles west from the Rio Grande at El Paso, says: "The separate grains
of the sand composing the sand hills are seen under a lens to be angular, and
not rounded, as would be the case in regular beach deposits."&mdash;<i>U. S. Mexican
Boundary Survey, Report of</i>, vol. i, <i>Geological Report of C. C. Parry</i>, p. 10.
</p><p>
In the general description of the country traversed, same volume, p.
47, Colonel Emory says that on an "examination of the sand with a
microscope of sufficient power," the grains are seen to be angular, not
rounded by rolling in water.
</p><p>
On the other hand, Blake, in <i>Geological Report, Pacific Railroad Rep.</i>,
vol. v, p. 119, observes that the grains of the dune sand, consisting of
quartz, chalcedony, carnelian, agate, rose quartz, and probably chrysolite,
were much rounded; and on page 241, he says that many of the sand grains
of the Colorado desert are perfect spheres.
</p><p>
On page 20 of a report in vol. ii of the <i>Pacific Railroad Report</i>, by the
same observer, it is said that an examination of dune sands brought from
the Llano Estacado by Captain Pope, showed the grains to be "much
rounded by attrition."
</p><p>
The sands described by Mr. Parry and Colonel Emory are not from the
same localities as those examined by Mr. Blake, and the difference in their
character may denote a difference of origin or of age.</p></div>

of the peaks of the sand ridges to assume a conical form, Andresen states
that the hills of the inner or landward rows are sometimes <i>bow-shaped</i>,
and sometimes undulating in outline.&mdash;<i>Om Klitformationen</i>, p. 84. He
says further that: "Before an obstruction, two or three feet high and considerably
longer, lying perpendicularly to the direction of the wind, the
sand is deposited with a windward angle of from 6&deg; to 12&deg;, and the bank
presents a concave face to the wind, while, behind the obstruction, the
outline is convex;" and he lays it down as a general rule, that a slope,
<i>from</i> which sand is blown, is left with a concavity of about one inch of
depth to four feet of distance; a slope, <i>upon</i> which sand is dropped by the
wind, is convex. It appears from Andresen's figures, however, that the
concavity and convexity referred to, apply, not to the <i>horizontal longitudinal</i>
section of the sand bank, as his language unexplained by the
drawings might be supposed to mean, but to the <i>vertical cross-section</i>, and
hence the dunes he describes, with the exception above noted, do not correspond
to those of the American deserts.&mdash;<i>Om Klitformationen</i>, p. 86.
</p><p>
The dunes of Gascony, which sometimes exceed three hundred feet in
height, present the same concavity and convexity of <i>vertical</i> cross-section.
The slopes of these dunes are much steeper than those of the Netherlands
and the Danish coast; for while all observers agree in assigning to the seaward
and landward faces of those latter, respectively, angles of from 5&deg;

origin belongs to three different periods, in which important changes in
the relative level of sea and land have unquestionably taken place. * * *
Except in the deep depressions between them, the dunes are everywhere
sprinkled, to a considerable height, with brown oxydulated iron, which has
penetrated into the sand to the depth of from three to eighteen inches, and
colored it red. * * * Above the iron is a stratum of sand differing in
composition from ordinary sea sand, and on this, growing woods are always
found. * * * The gradually accumulated forest soil occurs in beds of
from one to three feet thick, and changes, proceeding upward, from gray
sand to black humus." Even on the third or seaward range, the sand
grasses appear and thrive luxuriantly, at least on the west coast, though.
Krause doubts whether the dunes of the east coast were ever thus protected.&mdash;<i>Der

further, and the narrow opening near Lochstadt had filled itself up with
sand. A great pine forest bound with its roots the dune sand and the
heath uninterruptedly from Danzig to Pillau. King Frederick William I
was once in want of money. A certain Herr von Korff promised to procure
it for him, without loan or taxes, if he could be allowed to remove
something quite useless. He thinned out the forests of Prussia, which
then, indeed, possessed little pecuniary value; but he felled the entire
woods of the Frische Nehrung, so far as they lay within the Prussian territory.
The financial operation was a success. The king had money, but
in the elementary operation which resulted from it, the state received irreparable
injury. The sea winds rush over the bared hills; the Frische Haff
is half-choked with sand; the channel between Elbing, the sea, and K&ouml;nigsberg
is endangered, and the fisheries in the Haff injured. The operation
of Herr von Korff brought the king 200,000 thalers. The state would
now willingly expend millions to restore the forests again."</p></div>

and French coasts, at the period of the Roman invasion, resembled
the moving sand hills of the present day, it is inconceivable that they
could have escaped the notice of so acute a physical geographer as Strabo;

</p><p>
The Old Northern language, the ancient tongue of Denmark, though
rich in terms descriptive of natural scenery, had no name for dune, nor do
I think the sand hills of the coast are anywhere noticed in Icelandic literature.
The modern Icelanders, in treating of the dunes of Jutland, call
them <i>klettr</i>, hill, cliff, and the Danish <i>klit</i> is from that source. The word
D&uuml;ne is also of recent introduction into German. Had the dunes been
distinguished from other hillocks, in ancient times, by so remarkable a
feature as the propensity to drift, they would certainly have acquired a
specific name in both Old Northern and German. So long as they were
wooded knolls, they needed no peculiar name; when they became formidable,
from the destruction of the woods which confined them, they
acquired a designation.</p></div>

growth of oaks. * * * The parts of this barrier, which are covered

expanses of fresh water in Eastern Prussia&mdash;which are divided from the
Baltic by narrow sand banks called Nehrungen, or, at sheltered points of
the coast, by fluviatile deposits called Werders&mdash;all have one or more open

fact, that some of these pools, though evidently not original formations
but mere accumulations of water dammed up by the dunes, have,
along their western shore, near the base of the sand hills, a depth of more
than one hundred and thirty feet, and hence their bottoms are not less
than eighty feet below the level of the lowest tides. Their western banks
descend steeply, conforming nearly to the slope of the dunes, while on the
northeast and south the inclination of their beds is very gradual. The
greatest depth of these pools corresponds to that of the sea ten miles from
the shore. Is it possible that the weight of the sands has pressed together
the soil on which they rest, and thus occasioned a subsidence of the surface
extending beyond their base? See <i>Appendix</i>, <a href="#app_61">No. 61</a>.</p></div>

The creation of new dunes, by the processes mentioned in the text,
seems to be much older in Europe than the adoption of measures for securing
them by planting. Dr. Dwight mentions a case in Massachusetts,
where a beach was restored, and new dunes formed, by planting beach
grass. "Within the memory of my informant, the sea broke over the
beach which connects Truro with Province Town, and swept the body of
it away for some distance. The beach grass was immediately planted on
the spot; in consequence of which the beach was again raised to a sufficient
height, and in various places into hills."&mdash;<i>Dwight's Travels</i>, iii, p. 93.</p></div>

Massachusetts, during the colonial period, though I believe they are now
substantially abandoned. A hundred years ago, before the valley of the
Mississippi, or even the rich plains of Central and Western New York,
were opened to the white settler, the value of land was relatively much
greater in New England than it is at present, and consequently some rural
improvements were then worth making, which would not now yield sufficient
returns to tempt the investment of capital. The money and the time
required to subdue and render productive twenty acres of sea sand on Cape
Cod, would buy a "section" and rear a family in Illinois. The son of the
Pilgrims, therefore, abandons the sand hills, and seeks a better fortune on
the fertile prairies of the West.
</p><p>
Dr. Dwight, who visited Cape Cod in the year 1800, after describing
the "beach grass, a vegetable bearing a general resemblance to sedge, but
of a light bluish-green, and of a coarse appearance," which "flourishes
with a strong and rapid vegetation on the sands," observes that he received
"from a Mr. Collins, formerly of Truro, the following information:"
"When he lived at Truro, the inhabitants were, under the authority of
law, regularly warned in the month of April, yearly, to plant beach grass,
as, in other towns of New England, they are warned to repair highways.
It was required by the laws of the State, and under the proper penalties
for disobedience; being as regular a public tax as any other. The people,
therefore, generally attended and performed the labor. The grass was dug
in bunches, as it naturally grows; and each bunch divided into a number
of smaller ones. These were set out in the sand at distances of three feet.
After one row was set, others were placed behind it in such a manner as to
shut up the interstices; or, as a carpenter would say, so as to break the
joints. * * * When it is once set, it grows and spreads with rapidity.
* * * The seeds are so heavy that they bend down the heads of the
grass; and when ripe, drop directly down by its side, where they immediately
vegetate. Thus in a short time the ground is covered.
</p><p>
"Where this covering is found, none of the sand is blown. On the
contrary, it is accumulated and raised continually as snow gathers and
rises among bushes, or branches of trees cut and spread upon the earth.
Nor does the grass merely defend the surface on which it is planted; but
rises, as that rises by new accumulations; and always overtops the sand,
however high that may be raised by the wind."&mdash;<i>Dwight's Travels in New
England and New York</i>, ii, p. 92, 93.
</p><p>
This information was received in 1800, and it relates to a former state
of things, probably more than twenty years previous, and earlier than
1779, when the Government of Denmark first seriously attempted the conquest
of the dunes.
</p><p>
The depasturing of the beach grass&mdash;a plant allied in habits, if not in
botanical character, to the arundo&mdash;has been attended with very injurious
effects in Massachusetts. Dr. Dwight, after referring to the laws for its
propagation, already cited, says: "The benefit of this useful plant, and of
these prudent regulations, is, however, in some measure lost. There are in
Province Town, as I was informed, one hundred and forty cows. These
animals, being stinted in their means of subsistence, are permitted to
wander, at times, in search of food. In every such case, they make depredations
on the beach grass, and prevent its seeds from being formed. In
this manner the plant is ultimately destroyed."&mdash;<i>Travels</i>, iii, p. 94.
</p><p>
On page 101 of the same volume, the author mentions an instance of
great injury from this cause. "Here, about one thousand acres were
entirely blown away to the depth, in many places, of ten feet. * * *
Not a green thing was visible except the whortleberries, which tufted a
few lonely hillocks rising to the height of the original surface and prevented
by this defence from being blown away also. These, although they varied
the prospect, added to the gloom by their strongly picturesque appearance,
by marking exactly the original level of the plain, and by showing us in
this manner the immensity of the mass which had been thus carried away
by the wind. The beach grass had been planted here, and the ground had
been formerly enclosed; but the gates had been left open, and the cattle
had destroyed this invaluable plant."</p></div>

pineries of the Carolinas, but they are better systematized and more
economically conducted in France. In the latter country, all the products
of the pine, even to the cones, find a remunerating market, while, in
America, the price of resin is so low, that in the fierce steamboat races
on the great rivers, large quantities of it are thrown into the furnaces to
increase the intensity of the fires. In a carefully prepared article on the
Southern pineries published in an American magazine&mdash;I think Harper's&mdash;a
few years ago, it was stated that the resin from the turpentine distilleries
was sometimes allowed to run to waste; and the writer, in one instance,
observed a mass, thus rejected as rubbish, which was estimated to amount
to two thousand barrels. See <i>Appendix</i>, <a href="#app_62">No. 62</a>.</p></div>

the British Islands, but I find no estimate of their area. Pannewitz (<i>Anleitung
zam Anbau der Sandfl&auml;chen</i>), as cited by Andresen (<i>Om Klitformationen</i>,
p. 45), states that the drifting sands of Europe, including, of
course, sand plains as well as dunes, cover an extent of 21,000 square miles.
This is, perhaps, an exaggeration, though there is, undoubtedly, much more
desert land of this description on the European continent than has been
generally supposed. There is no question that most of this waste is capable
of reclamation by simple planting, and no mode of physical improvement
is better worth the attention of civilized Governments than this.
</p><p>
There are often serious objections to extensive forest planting on soils
capable of being otherwise made productive, but they do not apply to sand
wastes, which, until covered by woods, are not only a useless incumbrance,
but a source of serious danger to all human improvements in the neighborhood
of them.</p></div>

permission to establish themselves in this desert; but political
and religious prejudices prevented the granting of this liberty. At this
period the Moors were a far more cultivated people than their Christian

and at its sides, and finally in front, with scori&aelig;, formed by the cooling of
the exposed surface, which bury and conceal the fluid mass. The stream
rolls on under the coating, and between the walls of scori&aelig;, and it was the
lateral crust which was broken through by the workmen mentioned in
the text.
</p><p>
The distance to which lava flows, before its surface begins to solidify,
depends on its volume, its composition, its temperature and that of the air,
the force with which it is ejected, and the inclination of the declivity over
which it runs. In most cases it is difficult to approach the current at points
where it is still entirely fluid, and hence opportunities of observing it in
that condition are not very frequent. In the eruption of February, 1850,
on the east side of Vesuvius, I went quite up to one of the outlets. The
lava shot out of the orifice upward with great velocity, like the water
from a spring, in a stream eight or ten feet in diameter, throwing up occasionally
volcanic bombs, but it immediately spread out on the declivity
down which it flowed, to the width of several yards. It continued red hot
in broad daylight, and without a particle of scori&aelig; on its surface, for a
course of at least one hundred yards. At this distance, the suffocating,
sulphurous vapors became so dense that I could follow the current no farther.
The undulations of the surface were like those of a brook swollen
by rain. I estimated the height of the waves at five or six inches by a
breadth of eighteen or twenty. To the eye, the fluidity of the lava seemed
as perfect as that of water, but masses of cold lava weighing ten or fifteen
pounds floated upon it like cork.
</p><p>
The heat emitted by lava currents seems extremely small when we consider
the temperature required to fuse such materials and the great length
of time they take in cooling. I saw at Nicolosi ancient oil jars, holding a
hundred gallons or more, which had been dug out from under a stream of
old lava above that town. They had been very slightly covered with volcanic
ashes before the lava flowed over them, but the lead with which
holes in them had been plugged was not melted. The current that buried
Mompiliere in 1669 was thirty-five feet thick, but marble statues, in a
church over which the lava formed an arch, were found uncalcined and
uninjured in 1704. See <span class="smcap">Scrope</span>, <i>Volcanoes</i>, chap. VI. &sect; 6.</p></div>

fire, sometimes continue to burn for months. I take the following account
of a case of this sort from a recent American journal:
</p><p>
"<span class="smcap">A Curious Phenomenon.</span>&mdash;When the track of the railroad between
Brunswick and Bath was being graded, in crossing a meadow near the
populous portion of the latter city, the 'dump' suddenly took on a sinking
symptom, and down went the twenty feet fill of gravel, clay, and
broken rocks, out of sight, and it was a long, <i>long</i> time before dirt trains
could fill the capacious stomach that seemed ready to receive all the solid
material that could be turned into it. The difficulty was at length overcome,
but all along the side of the sinkage the earth was thrown up, broken
into yawning chasms, and the surface was thus elevated above its old watery
level. Since that time this ground, thus slightly elevated, has been cultivated,
and has yielded enormously of whatever the owner seemed disposed
to plant upon it. Some three months ago, by some means unknown to us,
the underlying peat took fire, and for weeks, as we had occasion to pass it,
we noticed the smoke arising from the smouldering combustion beneath
the surface. Rains fell, but the fire burned, and the smoke continued to
arise. Monday we had occasion to pass the spot, and though nearly a
week's rain had been drenching the ground, and though the surface was
whitened with snow, and though pools of water were standing upon the
surface in the immediate neighborhood, still the everlasting subterranean
fire was burning, and the smoke arising through the snow."</p></div>

that have been prompted by the researches of modern science, was made
by Babbage in the ninth chapter of his <i>Ninth Bridgewater Treatise</i>. I
have not the volume at hand, but the following explanation will recall to the
reader, if it does not otherwise make intelligible, the suggestion I refer to.
</p><p>
No atom can be disturbed in place, or undergo any change of temperature,
of electrical state, or other material condition, without affecting, by
attraction or repulsion or other communication, the surrounding atoms.
These, again, by the same law, transmit the influence to other atoms, and
the impulse thus given extends through the whole material universe.
Every human movement, every organic act, every volition, passion, or
emotion, every intellectual process, is accompanied with atomic disturbance,
and hence every such movement, every such act or process affects all the
atoms of universal matter. Though action and reaction are equal, yet reaction
does not restore disturbed atoms to their former place and condition,
and consequently the effects of the least material change are never cancelled,
but in some way perpetuated, so that no action can take place in
physical, moral, or intellectual nature, without leaving all matter in a different
state from what it would have been if such action had not occurred.
Hence, to use language which I have employed on another occasion: there
exists, not alone in the human conscience or in the omniscience of the
Creator, but in external material nature, an ineffaceable, imperishable
record, possibly legible even to created intelligence, of every act done,
every word uttered, nay, of every wish and purpose and thought conceived
by mortal man, from the birth of our first parent to the final extinction of
our race; so that the physical traces of our most secret sins shall last until
time shall be merged in that eternity of which not science, but religion
alone, assumes to take cognizance.</p></div>

note on p. 19&mdash;and indeed all cases of a supposed acclimation consisting in
physiological changes&mdash;are instances of the origination of new varieties by
natural selection, the hardier maize, tomato, and other vegetables of the
North, being the progeny of seeds of individuals endowed, exceptionally,
with greater power of resisting cold than belongs in general to the species
which produced them. But, so far as the evidence of change of climate,
from a difference in vegetable growth, is concerned, it is immaterial whether
we adopt this view or maintain the older and more familiar doctrine
of a local modification of character in the plants in question.</p>

<p><a name="app_3" id="app_3"></a>No. 3 (<a href="#Page_31">page 31</a>). I find a confirmation of my observations on the habits
of the beaver as a geographical agency, in a report of the proceedings of
the British Association, in the London Athen&aelig;um of October 8, 1864, p.
469. It is there stated that Viscount Milton and Dr. Cheadle, in an expedition
across the Rocky Mountains by the Yellow Head, or Leather Pass,
observed that "a great portion of the country to the east of the mountains"
had been "completely changed in character by the agency of the
beaver, which formerly existed here in enormous numbers. The shallow
valleys were formerly traversed by rivers and chains of lakes which, dammed
up along their course at numerous points, by the work of those animals,
have become a series of marshes in various stages of consolidation.
So complete has this change been, that hardly a stream is found for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
distance of two hundred miles, with the exception of the large rivers. The
animals have thus destroyed, by their own labors, the waters necessary
to their own existence."</p>

<p>When the process of "consolidation" shall have been completed, and
the forest re&euml;stablished upon the marshes, the water now diffused through
them will be collected in the lower or more yielding portions, cut new
channels for their flow, become running brooks, and thus restore the ancient
aspect of the surface.</p>

almost uniformly confine their ravages to trees already unsound or diseased
in growth from the depredations of leaf-eaters, such as caterpillars
and the like, or from other causes. The decay of the tree, therefore, is the
cause not the consequence of the invasions of the borer. This subject has
been discussed by Perris in the <i>Annales de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Entomologique de la
France</i>, for 1851 (?), and his conclusions are confirmed by the observations
of Samanos, who quotes, at some length, the views of Perris. "Having,
for fifteen years," says the latter author, "incessantly studied the habits
of lignivorous insects in one of the best wooded regions of France, I have
observed facts enough to feel myself warranted in expressing my conclusions,
which are: that insects in general&mdash;I am not speaking of those
which confine their voracity to the leaf&mdash;do not attack trees in sound
health, and they assail those only whose normal conditions and functions
have been by some cause impaired."</p>

<p>I once saw several quarts of beech-nuts taken from the winter quarters

and other authorities many interesting facts respecting instincts lost, or
newly developed and become hereditary, in the lower animals, and he
quotes Aristotle and Pliny as evidence that the common quadrupeds and
fowls of our fields and our poultry yards were much less perfectly domesticated
in their times than long, long ages of servitude have now made
them.</p>

<p>Perhaps the half-wild character ascribed by P. L&aelig;stadius and other
Swedish writers to the reindeer of Lapland, may be in some degree due to
the comparative shortness of the period during which he has been partially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>

<p>Among other instances of obliterated instincts, Schroeder van der Kolk

calves are not weaned until several weeks old, they resort to the udder as

An English botanist, in an hour's visit to Aden, discovered several species

cosmopolite in its habits, yet particular <i>varieties</i> are extremely fastidious
and exclusive in their requirements as to soil and climate. The stocks of
many celebrated vineyards lose their peculiar qualities by transplantation,
and the most famous wines are capable of production only in certain well-defined,
and for the most part narrow districts. The Ionian vine which
bears the little stoneless grape known in commerce as the Zante currant,
has resisted almost all efforts to naturalize it elsewhere, and is scarcely
grown except in two or three of the Ionian islands and in a narrow territory
on the northern shores of the Morea.</p>

and hence Alpine plants often shoot up at the foot of the mountains, the
grasses of the plain on the borders of the glaciers; but in both cases, they
usually fail to propagate themselves by ripening their seed. This explains
the scattered tufts of common clover, with pale and flaccid blossoms, which

1859 and the following years, is a noticeable exception to the law of
regularity which seems to govern the movements and determine the habitat
of birds. The proper home of this bird is the steppes of Tartary, and it is
not recorded to have been observed in Europe, or at least west of Russia,
until the year abovementioned, when many flocks of twenty or thirty, and
even a hundred individuals, were seen in Bohemia, Germany, Holland,
Denmark, England, Ireland, and France. A considerable flock frequented
the Frisian island of Borkum for more than five months. It was hoped they
would breed and remain permanently in the island, but this expectation
has been disappointed, and the steppe-grouse seems to have disappeared
again altogether.</p>

in some parts of France, is a singular and startling fact.</p>

<p>Toussenel, quoting from official documents, states, that upon the offer
of a reward of fifty centimes, or ten cents, a head, <i>twelve thousand</i> vipers
were brought to the prefect of a single department, and that in 1859 fifteen
hundred snakes and twenty quarts of snakes' eggs were found under a
farm-house hearthstone. The granary, the stables, the roof, the very beds
swarmed with serpents, and the family were obliged to abandon its habitation.
Dr. Viaugrandmarais, of Nantes, reported to the prefect of his department
more than two hundred recent cases of viper bites, twenty-four
of which proved fatal.&mdash;<i>Tristia</i>, p. 176 <i>et seqq.</i></p>

the fresh water fish of the North American States, and accommodate them
to the now physical conditions of their native waters. Hence it may be
hoped that nature, even unaided by art, will do something toward restoring
the ancient plenty of our lakes and rivers. The decrease of our fresh
water fish cannot be ascribed alone to exhaustion by fishing, for in the
waters of the valleys and flanks of the Alps, which have been inhabited
and fished ten times as long by a denser population, fish are still very
abundant, and they thrive and multiply under circumstances where no
American species could live at all. On the southern slope of those mountains,
trout are caught in great numbers, in the swift streams which rush
from the glaciers, and where the water is of icy coldness, and so turbid
with particles of fine-ground rock, that you cannot see an inch below the
surface. The glacier streams of Switzerland, however, are less abundant
in fish.</p>

most valuable Report on the Physics and Hydraulics of the Mississippi,
conclude that the delta of that river began its encroachments on the Gulf
of Mexico not more than 4,400 years ago, before which period they suppose
the Mississippi to have been "a comparatively clear stream," conveying
very little sediment to the sea. The present rate of advance of the
delta is 262 feet a year, and there are reasons for thinking that the amount
of deposit has long been approximately constant.&mdash;<i>Report</i>, pp. 435, 436.</p>

<p>The change in the character of the river must, if this opinion is well
founded, be due to some geological revolution, or at least convulsion, and
the hypothesis of the former existence of one or more great lakes in its

has been suggested. The shores of these supposed lakes have not, I believe,
been traced, or even detected, and we cannot admit the truth of this
hypothesis without supposing changes much more extensive than the mere
bursting of the barrier which confined the waters.</p>

trees, resist frosts of extraordinary severity better than the deciduous

is developed?</p>

mountains on precipitation, meteorologists have generally treated the
popular belief, that mountains "attract" to them clouds floating within a
certain distance from them, as an ignorant prejudice, and they ascribe the
appearance of clouds about high peaks solely to the condensation of the
humidity of the air carried by atmospheric currents up the slopes of the
mountain to a colder temperature. But if mountains do not really draw
clouds and invisible vapors to them, they are an exception to the universal
law of attraction. The attraction of the small Mount Shehallien was found
sufficient to deflect from the perpendicular, by a measurable quantity, a
plummet weighing but a few ounces. Why, then, should not greater masses
attract to them volumes of vapor weighing hundreds of tons, and floating
freely in the atmosphere within moderate distances of the mountains?</p>

of wood and timber for fuel and other domestic and rural purposes,
in many parts of Europe, seems incredibly small to an American. In
rural Switzerland, the whole supply of firewood, fuel for small smitheries,
dairies, breweries, brick and lime kilns, distilleries, fences, furniture, tools,
and even house building&mdash;exclusive of the small quantity derived from the
trimmings of fruit trees, grape vines and hedges, and from decayed fences
and buildings&mdash;does not exceed an average of <i>two hundred and thirty cubic
feet</i>, or less than two cords, a year per household. The average consumption
of wood in New England for domestic fuel alone, is from five to ten
times as much as Swiss families require for all the uses above enumerated.
But the existing habitations of Switzerland are sufficient for a population
which increases but slowly, and in the peasants' houses but a single room
is usually heated. See <i>Bericht &uuml;ber die Untersuchung der Schweiz. Hochgebirgswaldungen</i>,

work has lately been published in France by Viscount de Courval, which
is known to me only by a German translation published at Berlin, in 1864,
under the title, <i>Das Auf&auml;sten der Waldb&auml;ume</i>. The principal feature of
De Courval's very successful system of sylviculture, is a mode of trimming
which compels the tree to develop the stem by reducing the lateral ramification.
Beginning with young trees, the buds are rubbed off from the
stems, and superfluous lateral shoots are pruned down to the trunk. When
large trees are taken in hand, branches which can be spared, and whose
removal is necessary to obtain a proper length of stem, are very smoothly
cut off quite close to the trunk, and the exposed surface is <i>immediately</i>
brushed over with mineral-coal tar. When thus treated, it is said that the
healing of the wound is perfect, and without any decay of the tree.</p>

in the vegetation of Europe, has been in the valleys of the Durance
and its tributaries in Dauphiny. I must admit that neither in variety nor
in purity and brilliancy of tint, does this coloring fall much, if at all, short
of that of the New England woods. But there is this difference: in
Dauphiny, it is only in small shrubs that this rich painting is seen, while
in North America the foliage of large trees is dyed in full splendor.
Hence the American woodland has fewer broken lights and more of what
painters call breadth of coloring. Besides this, the arrangement of the
leafage in large globular or conical masses, affords a wider scale of light
and shade, thus aiding now the gradation, now the contrast of tints, and
gives the American October landscape a softer and more harmonious tone
than marks the humble shrubbery of the forest hill-sides of Dauphiny.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span></p>

<p>Few men have personally noticed so many facts in natural history accessible
to unscientific observation as Thoreau, and yet he had never seen
that very common and striking spectacle, the phosphorescence of decaying
wood, until, in the latter years of his life, it caught his attention in a
bivouac in the forests of Maine. He seems to have been more excited by
this phenomenon than by any other described in his works. It must be a

<p>Judging from my own observation, however, I should much doubt
whether this brilliant phenomenon can be so often seen in perfection as

where, in the elevated Alpine valleys, it shows itself in the greatest
splendor.</p>

is not founded on personal observation, often describe its trunk as not only
slender, but particularly <i>straight</i>. Nothing can be farther from the truth.
When the Orientals compare the form of a beautiful girl to the stem of the
palm, they do not represent it as rigidly straight, but on the contrary as
made up of graceful curves, which seem less like permanent outlines than
like flowing motion. In a palm grove, the trunks, so far from standing
planted upright like the candles of a chandelier, bend in a vast variety of
curves, now leaning towards, now diverging from, now crossing, each
other, and among a hundred you will hardly see two whose axes are

<i>Salicornia herbacea</i> appears as soon as the flat is raised high enough to be
dry for three hours at ordinary ebb tide, or, in other words, where the
ordinary flood covers it to a depth of not more than two feet. At a flood
depth of one foot, the <i>Salicornia</i> dies and is succeeded by various sand
plants. These are followed by <i>Poa distans</i> and <i>Poa maritima</i> as the
ground is raised by further deposits, and these plants finally by common
grasses. The <i>Salicornia</i> is preceded by <i>conferv&aelig;</i>, growing in deeper water,

these objects might not have been adopted with advantage. It
has been suggested that a system of inland dikes and canals, upon the principle
of those which, as will be seen in a subsequent part of the chapter on
the waters, have been so successfully employed in the Val di Chiana and in
Egypt, might have elevated the low grounds above the ocean tides, by
spreading over them the sediment brought down by the Rhine, the Maes,
and the Scheld. If this process had been introduced in the Middle Ages
and constantly pursued to our times, the superficial and coast geography,
as well as the hydrography of the countries in question, would undoubtedly
have presented an aspect very different from their present condition;
and by combining the process with a system of maritime dikes, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
would have been necessary, both to resist the advance of the sea and to
retain the slime deposited by river overflows, it is possible that the territory
of those states would have been as extensive as it now is, and, at the
same time, more elevated by several feet. But it must be borne in mind
that we do not know the proportions in which the marine deposits that
form the polders have been derived from materials brought down by these
rivers or from other more remote sources. Much of the river slime has no
doubt been transported by marine currents quite beyond the reach of returning
streams, and it is uncertain how far this loss has been balanced
by earth washed by the sea from distant shores and let fall on the coasts
of the Netherlands and other neighboring countries.</p>

<p>We know little or nothing of the quantity of solid matter brought down
by the rivers of Western Europe in early ages, but, as the banks of those
rivers are now generally better secured against wash and abrasion than in
former centuries, the sediment transported by them must be less than at
periods nearer the removal of the primitive forests of their valleys. Kl&ouml;den
states the quantity of sedimentary matter now annually brought down by
the Rhine at Bonn to be sufficient only to cover a square English mile to
the depth of a little more than a foot.&mdash;<i>Erdkunde</i>, I. p. 384.</p>

<p><a name="app_42" id="app_42"></a>No. 42 (<a href="#Page_358">page 358, <i>first paragraph</i></a>). Meteorological observations have
been regularly recorded at Zwanenburg, near the north end of the Lake of
Haarlem, for more than a century, and since 1845 a similar register has
been kept at the Helder, forty or fifty miles farther north. In comparing
these two series of observations, it is found that about the end of the year
1852, when the drawing off of the waters of the Lake of Haarlem was
completed, and the preceding summer had dried the grounds laid bare so
as greatly to reduce the evaporable surface, a change took place in the
relative temperature of the two stations. Taking the mean of every successive
period of five days from 1845 to 1852, the temperature at Zwanenburg
was thirty-three hundredths of a centigrade degree <i>lower</i> than at the
Helder. Since the end of 1852, the thermometer at Zwanenburg has stood,
from the 11th of April to the 20th of September inclusive, twenty-two
hundredths of a degree <i>higher</i> than at the Helder, but from the 14th of
October to the 17th of March, it has averaged one-tenth of a degree <i>lower</i>
than its mean between the same dates before 1853.</p>

<p>There is no reasonable doubt that these differences are due to the draining
of the lake. There has been less refrigeration from evaporation in
summer, and the ground has absorbed more solar heat at the same period,
while in the winter it has radiated more warmth then when it was covered
with water. Doubtless the quantity of humidity contained in the
atmosphere has also been affected by the same cause, but observations do
not appear to have been made on that point. See <span class="smcap">Krecke</span>, <i>Het Klimaat
van Nederland</i>, II. 64.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span></p>

have been several land slips on the borders of the Lake of Como, and in
one instance the grounds of a villa lying upon the margin of the water
suffered a considerable displacement. If the lake should be lowered to
any considerable extent, in pursuance of the plan mentioned in the note on
page 358, there is ground to fear that the steep shores of the lake might,
at some points, be deprived of a lateral pressure requisite to their stability,
and slide into the water as on the Lake of Lungern. See p. 356.</p>

<p><a name="app_44" id="app_44"></a>No. 44 (<a href="#Footnote_332_332">page 369, <i>last paragraph but one of note</i></a>). In like manner,
while the box, the cedar, the fir, the oak, the pine, "beams," and "timber,"
are very frequently mentioned in the Old Testament, not one of these
words is found in the New, <i>except</i> the case of the "beam in the eye," in
the parable in Matthew and Luke.</p>

<p><a name="app_45" id="app_45"></a>No. 45 (<a href="#Footnote_339_339">page 375, <i>note</i></a>). In all probability, the real change effected by
human art in the superficial geography of Egypt, is the conversion of pools
and marshes into dry land, by a system of transverse dikes, which compelled
the flood water to deposit its sediment on the banks of the river instead
of carrying it to the sea. The <i>colmate</i> of modern Italy were thus anticipated
in ancient Egypt.</p>

<p><a name="app_46" id="app_46"></a>No. 46 (<a href="#Page_378">page 378</a>). We have seen in <i>Appendix</i>, No. 42, <i>ante</i>, that the
mean temperature of a station on the borders of the Lake of Haarlem&mdash;a
sheet of water formerly covering sixty-two and a half square English
miles&mdash;for the period between the 11th of April and the 20th of September,
had been raised not less than a degree of Fahrenheit by the draining
of that lake; or, to state the case more precisely, that the formation of the
lake, which was a consequence of man's improvidence, had reduced the
temperature one degree F. below the natural standard. The artificially
irrigated lands of France, Piedmont, and Lombardy, taken together, are
fifty times as extensive as the Lake of Haarlem, and they are situated in
climates where evaporation is vastly more rapid than in the Netherlands.
They must therefore, no doubt, affect the local climate to a far greater
extent than has been observed in connection with the draining of the lake
in question. I do not know that special observations have been made with
a view to measure the climatic effects of irrigation, but in the summer I
have often found the <i>morning</i> temperature, when the difference would
naturally be least perceptible, on the watered plains of Piedmont, nine
miles south of Turin, several degrees lower than that recorded at an observatory
in the city.</p>

<p><a name="app_47" id="app_47"></a>No. 47 (<a href="#Footnote_352_352">page 391, <i>note</i></a>). The Roman aqueduct known as the Pont du
Gard, near Nismes, was built, in all probability, nineteen centuries ago.
The bed of the river Gardon, a rather swift stream, which flows beneath
it, can have suffered but a slight depression since the piers of the aqueduct
were founded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="app_48" id="app_48"></a>No. 48 (<a href="#Footnote_353_353">page 393, <i>first note</i></a>). Duponchel makes the following remarkable
statement: "The river Herault rises in a granitic region, but soon
reaches calcareous formations, which it traverses for more than sixty
kilometres, rolling through deep and precipitous ravines, into which the
torrents are constantly discharging enormous masses of pebbles belonging
to the hardest rocks of the Jurassian period. These debris, continually
renewed, compose, even below the exit of the gorge where the river enters
into a regular channel cut in a tertiary deposit, broad beaches, prodigious
accumulations of rolled pebbles, extending several kilometres down the
stream, but they diminish in size and weight so rapidly that above the
mouth of the river, which is at a distance of thirty or thirty-five kilometres
from the gorge, every trace of calcareous matter has disappeared from the
sands of the bottom, which are exclusively silicious."&mdash;<i>Avant-projet pour
la cr&eacute;ation d'un sol fertile</i>, etc., p. 20.</p>

<p><a name="app_49" id="app_49"></a>No. 49 (<a href="#Footnote_363_363">page 404, <i>first paragraph of second note</i></a>). The length of the
lower course of the Po having been considerably increased by the filling
up of the Adriatic with its deposits, the velocity of the current ought,
<i>prima facie</i>, to have been diminished and its bed raised in proportion.
There are grounds for believing that this has happened in the case of the
Nile, and one reason why the same effect has not been more sensibly perceptible
in the Po is, that the confinement of the current by continuous
embankments gives it a high-water velocity sufficient to sweep out deposits
let fall at lower stages and slower movements of the water. Torrential
streams tend first to excavate, then to raise, their beds. No general
law on this point can be stated in relation to the middle and lower course
of rivers. The conditions which determine the question of the depression
or elevation of a river bed are too multifarious, variable, and complex to be
subjected to formul&aelig;, and they can scarcely even be enumerated. See,
however, note on p. 431.</p>

<p><a name="app_50" id="app_50"></a>No. 50 (<a href="#Page_406">page 406, <i>first paragraph</i></a>). The system proposed in the text is
substantially the Egyptian method, the Nile dikes having been constructed
rather to retain than to exclude the water. The waters of rivers which
flow down planes of gentle inclination, deposit in their inundations the
largest proportion of their sediment as soon as, by overflowing their banks,
they escape from the swift current of the channel, and consequently the
immediate banks of such rivers become higher than the grounds lying
farther from the stream. In the "intervals," or "bottoms," of the great
North American rivers, the alluvial banks are elevated and dry, the flats
more remote from the river lower and swampy. This is generally observable
in Egypt, though less so than in the valley of the Mississippi, where,
below Cape Girardeau, the alluvial banks constitute natural glacis descending
as you recede from the river, at an average of seven feet in the first
mile.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Humphreys and Abbot's</span> <i>Report</i>, pp. 96, 97.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span></p>

<p>The Egyptian crossdikes, by retaining the water of the inundations,
compel it to let fall its remaining slime, and hence the elevation of the
remoter land goes on at a rate not very much slower than that of the immediate
banks. Probably transverse embankments would produce the
same effect in the Mississippi valley. In the great floods of this river, it is
observed that, at a certain distance from the channel, the bottoms, though
lower than the banks, are flooded to a less depth. See cross sections in
Plate IV. of Humphreys and Abbot's Report. This apparently anomalous
fact is due, I suppose, to the greater swiftness of the current of the
overflowing water in the low grounds, which are often drained through the
channels of rivers whose beds lie at a lower level than that of the Mississippi,
or by the bayous which are so characteristic a feature of the geography
of that valley. A judicious use of dikes would probably convert
the swamps of the lower Mississippi valley into a region like Egypt.</p>

<p><a name="app_51" id="app_51"></a>No. 51 (<i>second note</i>). The mean discharge of the Mississippi is 675,000
cubic feet per second, and, accordingly, that river contributes to the sea about
eleven times as much water as the Po, and more than sis and a half times
as much as the Nile. The discharge of the Mississippi is estimated at one-fourth
of the precipitation in its basin, certainly a very large proportion,
when we consider the rapidity of evaporation in many parts of the basin, and
the probable loss by infiltration.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Humphreys and Abbot's</span> <i>Report</i>, p. 93.</p>

water have been advantageously used in civil engineering for displacing
and transporting large quantities of earth, and there is no doubt that this
agency might be profitably employed to a far greater extent than has yet
been attempted. Some of the hydraulic works in California for washing
down masses of auriferous earth are on a scale stupenduous enough to produce
really important topographical changes.</p>

other changes, fine sand intermixed with or deposited above a coarser
stratum, as well as the minute particles resulting from the disintegration
of the latter, may be carried by rain in the case of dunes, or by the ordinary
action of sea water in that of subaqueous sandbanks, down through
the interstices in the coarser layer, and thus the relative position of fine
sand and gravel may be more or less changed.&mdash;<i>Oorsprong der Hollandsche

Olmsted: "There is not a sufficient demand for rosin, except of the first
qualities, to make it worth transporting from the inland distilleries; it is
ordinarily, therefore, conducted off to a little distance, in a wooden trough,
and allowed to flow from it to waste upon the ground. At the first distillery
I visited, which had been in operation but one year, there lay a congealed
pool of rosin, estimated to contain over three thousand barrels."&mdash;<i>A

Holland, and France, one hundred and eighty-one German, or nearly four
thousand English square miles; in Scotland, about ten German, or two

improvement of the Landes, see Edmond About, <i>Le Progr&egrave;s</i>, Chap, VII.</p>

<p>In the memoir referred to in <i>Appendix</i>, No. 48, <i>ante</i>, Duponchel proposes
the construction of artificial torrents to grind calcareous rock to
slime by rolling and attrition in its bed, and, at the same time, the washing
down of an argillaceous deposit which is to be mixed with the calcareous
slime and distributed over the Landes by watercourses constructed for the
purpose. By this means, he supposes that a highly fertile soil could be
formed on the surface, which would also be so raised by the process as to
admit of freer drainage. That nothing may be wanting to recommend this
project, Duponchel suggests that, as some of the rivers of Western France
are auriferous, it is probable that gold enough may be collected from the
washings to reduce the cost of the operations materially.</p>

<p><a name="app_65" id="app_65"></a>No. 65 (<a href="#Page_528">page 528, <i>first paragraph</i></a>). The opening of a channel across
Cape Cod would have, though perhaps to a smaller extent, the same
effects in interchanging the animal life of the southern and northern shores
of the isthmus, as in the case of the Suez canal; for although the breadth
of Cape Cod does not anywhere exceed twenty miles, and is in some places
reduced to one, it appears from the official reports on the Natural History
of Massachusetts, that the population of the opposite waters differs widely
in species.</p>

<p>Not having the original documents at hand, I quote an extract from the
<i>Report on the Invertebrate Animals of Mass.</i>, given by Thoreau, <i>Excursions</i>,
p. 69: "The distribution of the marine shells is well worthy of
notice as a geological fact. Cape Cod, the right arm of the Commonwealth,
reaches out into the ocean some fifty or sixty miles. It is nowhere
many miles wide; but this narrow point of land has hitherto proved a
barrier to the migration of many species of mollusca. Several genera and
numerous species, which are separated by the intervention of only a few
miles of land, are effectually prevented from mingling by the Cape, and do
not pass from one side to the other * * * * Of the one hundred and
ninety-seven marine species, eighty-three do not pass to the south shore,
and fifty are not found on the north shore of the Cape."</p>

<p>Probably the distribution of the species of mollusks is affected by unknown
local conditions, and therefore an open canal across the Cape might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
not make every species that inhabits the waters on one side common to
those of the other; but there can be no doubt that there would be a considerable
migration in both directions.</p>

<p>The fact stated in the report may suggest an important caution in
drawing conclusions upon the relative age of formations from the character
of their fossils. Had a geological movement or movements upheaved to
different levels the bottoms of waters thus separated by a narrow isthmus,
and dislocated the connection between those bottoms, naturalists, in after
ages, reasoning from the character of the fossil faunas, might have assigned
them to different, and perhaps very widely distant, periods.</p>

<p><a name="app_66" id="app_66"></a>No. 66 (<a href="#Page_548">page 548, <i>first paragraph</i></a>). To the geological effects of the
thickening of the earth's crust in the Bay of Bengal, are to be added those
of thinning it on the highlands where the Ganges rises. The same action
may, as a learned friend suggests to me, even have a cosmical influence.
The great rivers of the earth, taken as a whole, transport sediment from
the polar regions in an equatorial direction, and hence tend to increase the
equatorial diameter, and at the same time, by their inequality of action, to
a continual displacement of the centre of gravity, of the earth. The motion
of the globe and of all bodies affected by its attraction, is modified by
every change of its form, and in this case we are not authorized to say that
such effects are in any way compensated.</p>

<h4>FORSYTH'S "CICERO."</h4>

<h3><big>A New Life of Cicero.</big></h3>

<h4>BY WILLIAM FORSYTH, M. A., Q. C.</h4>

<p class="center">With Twenty Illustrations. 2 vols. crown octavo. Printed on tinted and laid
paper. Price, $5.00.</p>


<p>The object of this work is to exhibit Cicero not merely as a Statesman and
an Orator, but as he was at home in the relations of private life, as a Husband,
a Father, a Brother, and a Friend. His letters are full of interesting details,
which enable us to form a vivid idea of how the old Romans lived 2,000 years
ago; and the Biography embraces not only a History of Events, as momentous
as any in the annals of the world, but a large amount of Anecdote and Gossip,
which amused the generation that witnessed the downfall of the Republic.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The <i>London Athen&aelig;uem</i> says: "Mr. Forsyth has rightly aimed to set before
us a portrait of Cicero in the modern style of biography, carefully gleaning
from his extensive correspondence all those little traits of character and habit
which marked his private and domestic life. These volumes form a very
acceptable addition to the classic library. The style is that of a scholar and a
man of taste."</p>

<p>From the <i>Saturday Review</i>:&mdash;"Mr. Forsyth has discreetly told his story,
evenly and pleasantly supplied it with apt illustrations from modern law,
eloquence, and history, and brought Cicero as near to the present time as the
differences of age and manners warrant. * * * These volumes we heartily
recommend as both a useful and agreeable guide to the writings and character
of one who was next in intellectual and political rank to the foremost man of all
the world, at a period when there were many to dispute with him the triple
crown of forensic, philosophic, and political composition."</p>

<p>"A scholar without pedantry, and a Christian without cant, Mr. Forsyth
seems to have seized with praiseworthy tact the precise attitude which it behoves
a biographer to take when narrating the life, the personal life, of Cicero. Mr.
Forsyth produces what we venture to say will become one of <i>the classics of
English biographical literature</i>, and will be welcomed by readers of all ages and
both sexes, of all professions and of no profession at all."&mdash;<i>London Quarterly.</i></p>

<p>"This book is a valuable contribution to our Standard Literature. It is a
work which will aid our progress towards the truth; it lifts a corner of the veil
which has hung over the scenes and actors of times so full of ferment, and
allows us to catch a glimpse of the stage upon which the great drama was
played."&mdash;<i>North American Review.</i></p></div>

<h4>LORD DERBY'S "HOMER."</h4>

<h3><big>The Iliad of Homer.</big></h3>

<h4>RENDERED INTO ENGLISH BLANK VERSE BY EDWARD, EARL OF DERBY.</h4>

<p class="center">From the fifth London Edition.<br />

Two volumes, royal octavo, on tinted paper. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Price $7.50 per vol.</p>


<h4>Extracts from Notices and Reviews from the English Quarterlies, &amp;c.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The merits of Lord Derby's translation may be summed up in one word: "it is
eminently attractive; it is instinct with life; it may be read with fervent interest; it is immeasurably
nearer than Pope to the text of the original. * * * We think that Lord Derby's
translation will not only be read, but read over and over again. * * * Lord Derby has given
to England a version far more closely allied to the original, and superior to any that has
yet been attempted in the blank verse of our language."&mdash;<i>Edinburgh Review, January
1865.</i></p>

<p>"As often as we return from even the best of them (other translations) to the translation
before us, we find ourselves in a purer atmosphere of taste. We find more spirit, more
tact in avoiding either trivial or conceited phrases, and altogether a presence of merits, and
an absence of defects which continues, as we read, to lengthen more and more the distance
between Lord Derby and the foremost of his competitors."&mdash;<i>London Quarterly Review,
January, 1865.</i></p>

<p>"While the versification of Lord Derby is such as Pope himself would have admired,
his Iliad is in all other essentials superior to that of his great rival. For the rest, if Pope is
dethroned what remains? * * * It is the Iliad we would place in the hands of English
readers as the truest counterpart of the original, the nearest existing approach to a reproduction
of that original's matchless feature."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>"Among those curiosities of literature which are also its treasures, Lord Derby's translation
of Homer must occupy a very conspicuous place. * * * Lord Derby's work is, on the
whole, more remarkable for the constancy of its excellence and the high level which it
maintains throughout, than for its special bursts of eloquence. It is uniformly worthy of
itself and its author."&mdash;<i>The Reader.</i></p>

<p>"Whatever may be the ultimate fate of this poem&mdash;whether it take sufficient hold of
the public mind to satisfy that demand for a translation of Homer which we have alluded
to, and thus become a permanent classic of the language, or whether it give place to the still
more perfect production of some yet unknown poet&mdash;it must equally be considered a
splendid performance; and for the present we have no hesitation in saying that it is by
far the best representation of Homer's Iliad in the English language."</p>
</div>

<h4>AMERICAN NOTICES.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The <i>Publishers Circular</i> says:&mdash;At the advanced age of sixty-five, the Earl of Derby,
leader of the Tory party in England, has published a translation of Homer, in blank
verse. Nearly all the London critics unite in declaring, with <i>The Times</i>, "that it is by
far the best representation of Homer's 'Iliad' in the English language." His purpose
was to produce a translation, and not a paraphrase&mdash;fairly and honestly giving the sense
of every passage and of every line. Without doubt the greatest of all living British orators,
he has now shown high poetic power as well as great scholarship.</p>

<p>From the <i>New York World</i>:&mdash;"The reader of English, who seeks to know what
Homer really was, and in what fashion he thought and felt and wrote, will owe to
Lord Derby his first honest opportunity of doing so. The Earl's translation is devoid alike of
pretension and of prettiness. It is animated in movement, simple and representative
to phraseology, breezy in atmosphere, if we may so speak, and pervaded by a refinement
of taste which is as far removed from daintiness or effeminacy as can well be imagined."</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
